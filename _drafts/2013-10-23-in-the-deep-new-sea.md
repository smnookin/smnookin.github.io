## A New Post

One hundred forty new species, ![](/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Giant_Tortoise.jpg), and two species of sharks roam the New England Aquarium’s new 26-foot deep 40-foot wide tank, which is the result of a $43-million, six-year renovation that revamped not only the Aquarium itself, but also its, research labs as well. 

The marine mammal center was constructed to expand out to the Boston harbor, allowing visitors to gather outside to watch fur seals and sea lions swim, play, and perform tricks for a more interactive experience. The Shark and Ray Touch Tank, popular amongst children, is brand new allowing visitors to stroke sharks and stingrays as the species swim by. In addition to the completed renovations specially targeted for visitors, the six-year renovation project also expanded the Aquarium’s Marine Stress Research Programs and improved labs. In addition, a fraction of the $17 million is contributed in the Aquarium’s effort in leading campaigns to support conservation and sustainability. The highlight of this massive undertaking, however, was a 10-month reconstruction of the famous, 20,000-gallon tank, home to more than 2000 species.  The new “coral” is actually made of fiberglass, a more fish friendly material to replace a harsher material that snagged the fish and caused injury. The installation of additional viewing windows allows for an improved viewing experience as visitors can view  the diverse array of fish, turtles, and sharks from the top of the tank from throughout the different locations in the aquarium. The top of the aquarium is now accessible to visitors, as the aquarium has allowed visitors to go to the very top and look directly into the blue-green waterThe water is pumped directly from Boston Harbor, copious amounts of tests occurs, and depending on those results and the outside conditions, the protocol for cleaning and managing the tank changes, making the new tank friendlier to the fish. 
Myrtle, the popular 550-pound green sea turtle is back. Visitors can now also see 40 additional species including the blacknose shark, midnight parrotfish, trumpet fish, and yellow goatfish. 
What most visitors won’t see, however, is the newly designed labs. There is a large team of researchers, scientists, oceanographers, and conservationist who are part of the less well-known, but very important efforts led by the Aquarium to support research, promote sustainability, and educate the general audience. Not only did the renovation improve the aquarium for the visitors, but it also improved labs and increased research space. Until this year, most labs were very outdated, and complex experiments were difficult to do on site. 
John Mandelman, Ph.D., a researcher who specializes in shark, stingrays, and skates at the aquarium, said, “I now can do more on site at the aquarium. A lot of my experiments are based off of taking blood and tissue sample, so it's really great that I can now run these tests so close to my office”. 
Dr. Mandelman conducts most of his research in Eleuthera, Bahamas. He primarily studies how sharks, stingrays, and skates react to stress induced by humans and large-scale fishing operations. As fishing becomes more industrialized and seafood becomes more popular around the world, he is researching how by-catch and other species including sharks, stingrays, and scallops are effected by dredging and commercial fishing. 
“The physiological consequences of [long line fishing] is still poorly misunderstood, and to study the effects of longline fishing we looked into how catch-and- release impact the exploited Caribbean Reef Shark,” Mandelman said. 
In the Bahamas, Dr. Mandelman and his team catch sharks using fishing hooks, and take blood samples to measure how much physical stress and trauma impact growth, feeding and swimming behavior, and the immune system. His research showed there was indeed a correlation between the stress level and the time sharks were captured. Documenting the physiological suffering of captured as a consequence of catch-and-release of sharks is vital in understanding effective fishery management, Mandelman’s study showed.
The aquarium hosts lectures, seminars, and events including sustainable seafood dinners so that researchers can educate and connect with the general audience. 
 “I could do all this research and publish several studies, but in the end what matters is how much the public audience can understand,” Mandelman said. Ultimately, the Aquarium should educate visitors about the aquatic world. His hope that the glistening new aquarium will attract more visitors, and the public will leave not only satisfied with the beauty of the deep, but with a better understanding of our dependence on it.
