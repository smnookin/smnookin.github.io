For sophomore Caroline Mak, the suicide of Phoebe Wang, a high school classmate who attended MIT, hit too close to home. Mak looked up to Phoebe as a mentor, someone who had inspired her to apply to MIT. On her blog, she wrote, “Phoebe gave me an anchor...she gave me a picture of reliability and approachability...She demystified, humanized a place that had intimidated me since middle school.”

 “For the upperclassman mentor from my high school to commit suicide, it was a wakeup call into MIT culture I didn’t see before,” Mak said.

According to the 2015 Healthy Minds Study, 49% of undergraduate respondents answered that they “prefer to deal with issues on their own” and that they “question how serious their needs are” as factors that caused them to receive fewer mental health services than they otherwise would have received. 

“In MIT culture right now, people just don’t talk to each other,” Mak said. “I wanted to improve the community through outreach. It’s really important to me that people have the right impressions of what resources are out there that are made clear.”

The semester after Phoebe’s death, Mak joined Peer Ears, a group of 40-some undergraduate students who are trained and mentored by MIT Mental Health to help students in their dorms with mental health issues. 

The program targets students who may be more comfortable speaking with a peer, rather than an authority figure at MIT. Peer Ears are confidential and non-mandated reporters, and the program currently covers 10 undergrad dorms and 3 sororities. 

Mak estimates that despite the program being in a soft launch state, 100 people across all residences have spoken to a Peer Ear. 

Taylor Sutton, a Peer Ear at Random Hall says he’s talked to peers about everything ranging from stress about classes to anxiety and depression. 
 
“A lot of it has been, stress about clases, family issues, impostor syndrome, having trouble getting used to being at MIT, stress about the future, especially considering career fair happened recently. Last year, before I was a peer ear, I talked to people about relationship issues, and about general anxiety and depression.”

## Confidentiality
For most issues, students can expect a higher level of confidentiality from Peer Ears than from members of their dorm’s house team, which includes housemasters, Graduate Residence Tutors (GRTs), and Residential Life Area Directors (RLADs).

“We are not required to report anything to Mental Health. We are not required to submit reports, nothing. Your conversation with us is completely confidential,” Mak said.

In contrast, for example, MIT’s GRTs, graduate students who live in the undergraduate dorms, are expected to “keep members of the House team, and/or administrators informed about serious or potentially serious/dangerous resident issues,” according to the Division of Student Life’s GRT position description. In addition, they are required to inform the Housemaster and or Area Director of “key incidents in the residence hall that require follow-up, or are medical or mental health in nature.”

Peer Ears emphasize that in most cases, they will point students to an appropriate resource at MIT and encourage them to follow-up and seek additional help. They may offer to make introductions or go with a student to Mental Health, but the decision to take further action is ultimately left up to the student.

## Suicide ideation
What about suicide ideation? Mak and Evelyn Florentine, a Peer Ear in Burton-Conner, say that as Peer Ears, they would not have to report it. However, they are expected to act.

“As a peer, you would make sure they find help, find a support network, make sure they’re ok,” says Mak.

Peer Ears may also discuss cases internally within the group or with their staff mentors at MIT Mental Health to seek advice about how to handle certain situations.  Florentine says they are careful to preserve anonymity.

“It’s important for us to have our own support network. In terms of that, we would bring it up if there’s someone we’re worried about. We wouldn’t even say their gender, we’d keep who they are as confidential as possible.”

Confidentiality, however, has its limits. Like MIT Medical’s confidentiality [policy](https://medical.mit.edu/services/mental-health-counseling/confidentiality), in cases where a student is in immediate danger of causing harm to themselves or others, more immediate action will be taken.

Florentine says, “If it was truly immediate danger, I’d call 911. If it reaches the level of where someone has pills, or has a gun, I would call someone immediately.”

Mak says that depending on the severity, she would bring in a member of the student’s house team, encourage them to go with her to MIT’s urgent care center, or contact the Dean on Call system.

## Non-mandatory reporting
One of the key differences between Peer Ears and employees of MIT Medical is that unlike employees, Peer Ears are not mandatory reporters. Massachusetts state laws designate certain professions as mandatory reporters, who are legally compelled to report cases or suspicion of abuse and neglect of children under the age of 18. Failure to do so can result in a fine up to $1000, or in cases of willful failure to report leading to severe harm of the child, a fine up to $5000 and up to 2.5 years in prison.

Because the group’s advisers at MIT Medical fall into this category, navigating issues involving child abuse can be tricky for Peer Ears. Florentine says that by omitting names, she can seek guidance from advisers while preserving a student’s privacy. 

“Because we don’t tell them the name, they don’t have anything to report. We’re the liaison between MIT students and Mental Health, and in order for us to be trusted, we cannot be mandatory reporters, but we’ll try to make sure you get your problems solved.”

At the same time, Florentine would strongly urge students to report the abuse. 

“Something I learned from my experience at the hotline is that if someone tells me there’s abuse in their family, we’d urge them to report it with us. Even if you give someone a name, there’s not much they can do. In order to report, you really do need the person you’re talking with to work with you and do it together. As a Peer Ear, it’s our job to work with people and make sure they feel comfortable with reporting things."
