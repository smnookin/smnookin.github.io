<p>When Facebook and Apple <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/perk-facebook-apple-now-pay-women-freeze-eggs-n225011">announced</a> that they’re going to cover the cost of egg freezing for their female employees, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/10/19/apple-facebook-tech-women-egg-freezing-column/17576725/" target="_blank">journalists</a>, bloggers and readers hopped on their digital soapboxes to bash the policy. <b>Veronica Thomas</b>, a twenty-five-year-old Harvard School of Public Health student, says everyone should chill out -- and stop trying to guess at other people's motivations for choosing certain jobs, having kids at a particular age, or not having kids at all.</p>

	<p>A lot has changed in the Catholic Church since 2013, when Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected as the Catholic Church’s new leader, Pope Francis. MIT sophomore <b>Scout Carpenter</b> discusses how Francis's <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2014/10/17/synod-bishops-take-steps-toward-transparency-tolerance/9eoiQH13CjsJPGEXGNpeJI/story.html" target="_blank">more modern approach to issues ranging from divorce to same-sex couples</a> has the potential to appeal to a generation at risk of leaving the Church for good.</a></p>

	<p>In the decades since Noam Chomsky created the Institute's first philosophy course in the 1950s, humanities at MIT have grown into a world-class collection of scholars. Senior <b>Anisha Gururaj</b> argues that for the MIT to live up to its status as a world-class university, it has to examine whether the role art and literature play within the larger community.</p>
