Every day at five thirty pm, Next House Dining opens for dinner. There’s already a line outside the dining hall, and that’s where you’ll find me and my friends. After saying hi to the card-swiper when walking in, chatting with the grill station worker while ordering my daily grilled cheese, and exchanging jokes with the comfort food server, I head to the table that my friends and I have sat at since the first day of freshman year. This table has been with us since the beginning, and even though it’s the same as every other table in the dining hall, it means something important to the people who sit at it everyday. We talk about whatever’s going on that day or whatever seems interesting to talk about that day. We laugh and tease and enjoy dinner, and every day after dinner we head to the basement to play table tennis. 
	Sometimes this daily game gets competitive, usually when one of us spikes the ball after someone else made a save to keep the game going, which in our world is an unthinkable breach of sportsmanship. We all have our special spots, the “face-shot” because Chris hit Kwabena in the face one time, the “chidoree” was named for some unknown reason, and my “cross-shot” because it barely hits the opposite edge of the table before flying off the side. Once in a while someone makes an amazing shot and we all get really excited for a couple of seconds, then someone does a surprise serve and the game starts again. While breaking to retrieve lost balls from under couches or in the stairwell, sometimes a crunching sound is heard and we all joke about the culprit being a ping pong ball killer or some such nonsense. This ritual can last up to an hour if we have time, or can be as short as ten minutes, but it always takes place whether we can afford the time away from work or not. After we’ve exhausted our supply of ping-pong balls or ran out of time, we head back up to our pile of homework and struggle through it together.
	Every once in a while we get lucky and get to go to a study break. Our most recent study break was a crepe fest, where my whole wing, 5W of Next House, gathered in our lounge overlooking the Charles and ate some great homemade crepes. No one eats and runs at these study breaks, in fact, we usually end up sitting together for hours talking about ideas for wing outings or discussing movies or news or pretty much anything that comes to mind.  While most of the conversations are just fun, somehow everyone comes away feeling better about their lives. We realize during those moments that we are all in the same boat, that we are not alone. It’s weird how even surrounded by hundreds of people students sometimes you can feel so alone. 
	During particularly stressful times, like finals or mid-semester when there are a bunch of midterms in one week, Next House will run a big study break for all of it’s residents. Last year during the spring semester’s finals, I blew off a couple of hours of studying by having fun at one such break. The house manager rented one of those inflatable obstacle courses, and my friends and I took turns racing each other through the course, enduring skinned knees from a fall, injured pride after a loss, and lifted spirits in general. We had a ton of fun forgetting about the important tests coming up, and were reminded that life isn’t all about getting A’s on exams, sharing great times with friends can be much more important in the long run. I probably can’t remember much of what I studied the rest of that day, but I will remember the six times it took me to run the course backwards and the smiles we had on our faces while sitting out in the courtyard together drinking lemonade and waiting our turns on the rented inflatable. 
	This weekend is the annual DormCon-sponsored apple-picking event. My friends and I have been looking forward to it since the start of term, and it’s given me something to think about when I’m in the middle of a hell-week or panicking during a test. I’d think to myself, “Yes, this sucks. Only two and a half more weeks until apple picking.” It may seem strange that we look forward to a simple trip that lasts only five hours, but it distracts us from our work and stress, which is a hard thing to do when you’re stuck at MIT.  We pay ten bucks and walk away with a bag of apples, some cider, a doughnut, a caramel apple, and a renewed sense of the big picture. 
	While these events may sound like little things to you, things that you might enjoy if you weren’t too busy or you were bored, they are the big events in my life at MIT. I’m part of several student groups on campus, three club sports teams, and while they are all great communities, nothing can compare to the family I have at Next House. We all unspeakably realize the importance of the little things, like a post-dinner ping-pong game or a movie night with friends. As (Kurt Vonnegut/Robert Brault) said “Enjoy the little things in life because one day you will realize they were the big things.” I’ve realized that these little things are the big things a bit early, and that has allowed me to enjoy them all the more.
