## Next House and IHTFP

![](/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/MIT_Next_House.jpg)
	Life as an undergrad at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is stressful, but  it is also the best life I can imagine. The thing that makes MIT so great for me is my dorm, Next House. Most people who are familiar with MIT know the student body's motto, IHTFP. A lot of students embrace the first version of the motto (_I Hate This F***ing Place_), but living in Next House has shaped my life at school, making me adopt the second version, _I Have Truly Found Paradise_.

	The difference between people who hate it at MIT and people who love it isn’t always that big. My dad always said happiness is a choice, and that applies to life at MIT as well. I believe you can choose to be happy here or you can choose to hate it and have your daily emotions develop from that negativity. We all have piles of homework, pressure to do research or find jobs, and clubs or activities to participate in, and there’s no denying that it’s stressful. But you can either decide to look at those things as a burden or see them as opportunities.

	My choice to be happy here mainly came from Next House. It is hard to hate it at MIT when you live surrounded by great people who love MIT. 

	When I finish classes for the day I get to go home to Next House. Aside from having the best dining hall on campus, Next also has the best staff. There’s Willie who works in the dining hall, Dennis who takes care of the buidling, and Joel who runs front desk just to name a few. Every morning you can count on Dennis waving students off to class with a “Have a good day Champ,” and if my freinds and I don't show up for dinner at our usual time Willie jokes about us being late. These types of interactions make Next feel just like a home, even the people who don’t live here care, and that is something that helps make life at MIT enjoyable instead of unbearably stressful.
	
    Of course, along with the awesome staff, the students are crucial in shaping the community of Next House. Whether you need help with a problem set or need to borrow some flour for baking, someone at Next will help you out. When you’re in the middle of a hell week and feel like you just can’t take anymore work usually someone turns up to rescue you. Sometimes that someone is the house master Jimmy with fresh cookies or sometimes it’s a friend who is struggling with you who tells you it will be alright.
	
    When I’m at dinner with all of my friends, we sit there laughing and talking and stealing each other’s food, then head down to play ping-pong after dinner. Dinner’s my favorite time of day, and last night when I was sitting there thinking about our upcoming ping-pong game, surrounded by awesome people, I realized that it’s the little things at MIT that make it worthwhile. It’s the daily ping pong game, the joking around with the desk worker, and the episode of Parks and Rec watched with friends that are the best parts of my day.  
	
    Someone once said, “Enjoy the little things in life because one day you will realize they were the big things.” Even my decision to live in Next House was a little thing, just a different click on the computer and I may not have had a remotely similar experience. I realized that all of those little things have a huge importance in my life, and that transformed _I hate this f***ing place_ into **_I Have Truly Found Paradise_**.
