First things first: I am not a mother, nor do I plan on being one anytime soon. I’m a 25-year-old graduate student preoccupied with finding a job that advances my career, provides good benefits, and is located in the same city as my boyfriend. I can’t assume to know any other person’s motivations for choosing certain jobs, having kids at a certain age, or not having kids at all. And neither should anyone else. 

But when Facebook and Apple announced last week that they’re going to cover the cost egg freezing, journalists, bloggers and readers hopped on their digital soapboxes to bash the policy. [_USA Today_](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/10/19/apple-facebook-tech-women-egg-freezing-column/17576725/) ran the story, “Hey Apple and Facebook, Freeze This,” while the [_San Francisco Chronicle_](http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Big-doubts-about-egg-freezing-perk-from-Apple-5829853.php) ran a piece entitled “Egg freezing perk from Apple, Facebook is Creepy.” Is it really “creepy” for women who choose to freeze their eggs their own personal and _private_ reasons? As far as I know, no employees from these Apple or Facebook have actually written any of these heated reactions. And [very few](http://time.com/3529240/facebook-apple-egg-freezing-positive/) women who’ve actually frozen their eggs have spoken up about the issue. And really, they shouldn’t have to. 

[_The_ _Boston Globe_’s Joanna Weiss](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/10/16/egg-freezing-message-lean-and-save-kids-for-later/dKGaoRtjrszo8OozNbj45K/story.html#comments) wrote an op-ed entitled, “Egg freezing message: Lean in now, and save the kids for later.” Perhaps some Facebook and Apple employees did get this message, but what they decide to do with the new benefit is entirely up to them. I can assure you, the majority of these women are not making decisions about parenthood and their careers on a whim. 

Everyone—men, women, parents, someday-parents, and never-parents—set priorities in their lives and make difficult trade-offs accordingly. This new egg freezing benefit just increases peoples’ options and provides an alternative pathway to parenthood—though certainly [not a guaranteed one](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/opinion/dont-depend-on-those-frozen-eggs.html?ref=todayspaper). When and whether people decide to have children is their business. That’s why it’s [against the law](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/practices/inquiries_marital_status.cfm) for employers to ask whether you have children or your future baby-making plans. Whether or not an Apple or Facebook worker chooses to freeze her eggs, her employer will never know thanks to patient protections under HIPPA.

What the employers probably _will_ know is if she decides to have kids. And for that choice, Apple and Facebook provide some of the [best family benefits](http://www.businessinsider.com/maternity-paternity-leave-policies-at-google-facebook-yahoo-twitter-microsoft-2013-8#ixzz3Gox9S1io) in the U.S. [Apple](http://fortune.com/2014/10/02/apple-employee-perks/) gives 18 weeks of total paid maternity leave, and Facebook offers 17 weeks of paid leave for mothers _and_ fathers, with no discrimination against same-sex partners or parents who adopt. Those figures compare to the 8 weeks of paid maternity leave offered by GE and the 6 by IBM. [Facebook](http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/parental-leave-policies-at-some-big-technology-firms/) also provides $4,000 in “baby cash,” covers adoption fees and subsidizes daycare. I’m certainly not saying that these work perks make it a breeze for employees to seamlessly balance work and family. The lucky Americans who manage to do that are [few and far between](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/nine_facts_about_family_and_work_real_final.pdf).

The message I’m getting from Apple and Facebook’s new policy isn’t that women have to hold off on kids to get ahead. It’s that employees who already get better benefits than most are getting even more. Silicone Valley’s goliath tech companies are known for their untraditional work perks, like on-site medical care, video arcades and barbershops. If anything, covering $20,000-worth of egg freezing is just another perk in a long list aimed at recruiting and retaining talented in the tech arena—a goal we’d typically applaud. 

And though it may sound like a futuristic sci-fi plot, I imagine the idea of an egg freezing benefit didn’t materialize out of thin air. These are major, multi-billion dollar companies, with human resources departments run by females. Isn’t it possible that some female employees at Apple and Facebook appreciate and use this benefit or that other women will choose to work there because of it? If so, who are we to judge their decisions? 

And even if you are freaked out or offended by the egg freezing perk, we’re talking about just two companies with around 57,000 employees combined. The U.S. workforce is made up of over 158 million people. It’s highly unlikely that these tech giants’ decisions to cover two cycles of egg freezing will spill over into other industries. If that were the case, then more companies would have paid parental leave that lasts longer than a couple weeks. 

Instead, the U.S. is the only industrialized company that doesn’t guarantee paid time off for new mothers. Only three other countries in the world—Swaziland, Lesotho, and Papua New Guinea—lack mandatory paid leave. New mothers are given just 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave. But nearly [40 percent](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/silicon-valley-maternity-leave-paternity-leave) of mothers don’t even qualify for that because they were recently hired, work part-time, or work for small companies. 

In addition to paid leave, other powerhouse countries often have paid leave for fathers and extended unpaid leave with guaranteed job projection. For instance, [the French](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/12/among-38-nations-u-s-is-the-holdout-when-it-comes-to-offering-paid-parental-leave/) offer up to 12 weeks of paid maternity leave and up to 6 years of protected leave—meaning mothers can’t be fired for taking a year off to spend time with her high school kids. Even among the [“100 Best Companies”](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/your-money/us-trails-much-of-the-world-in-providing-paid-family-leave.html?pagewanted=all) for families in the U.S., ranked by Working Mother, the average paid maternity leave was only seven weeks in 2012.

Facebook and Apple’s new egg freezing benefit has certainly sparked a heated debate about the expectations of female employees and the appropriate time to have kids. But a debate founded so completely on people’s personal opinions won’t get us anywhere. What I wish this new policy _would_ do is start a conversation about balancing work and family in the Capital—not just the sleek offices Silicon Valley. While female employees at Facebook and Apple have the luxury of choosing between four weeks of paid maternity leave and freezing the eggs for a later attempt at kids, most Americans don’t really have a choice at all.
