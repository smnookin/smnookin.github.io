News Story Rough Draft

	Should a student be punished when calling for help in an emergency? If the emergency is alcohol-related, the MIT administration says no. However, the same cannot be said for emergencies concerning any other prohibited substance. Until the most recent release of the Mind and Hand Book, the official guide to MIT’s policies, emergencies related to dangerous or illicit drugs were treated as disciplinary matters, with risks for any student found guilty of “facilitating” such activity. In other words, if a student had a medical emergency due to an overdose of a dangerous drug, not only would the administration treat the incident as a disciplinary matter, but also the student who called for help could be found guilty of not informing the authorities prior to the emergency that dangerous drugs were being used.
In 2013, MIT updated the alcohol-related emergency policy in the Mind and Hand Book from a policy that promised administrative and possibly disciplinary action for a student transported to the hospital in an alcohol-related emergency with what is commonly known as the “Good Samaritan Policy”. The official name for this policy is the “Practice for Seeking Help During Alcohol Related Medical Emergencies”, and it guarantees that an alcohol-related emergency will be treated as a health and safety matter rather than a disciplinary matter. This removes many barriers for students who need emergency assistance due to excessive alcohol consumption, and the administration has been applauded for making it much easier for students who need emergency medical attention to get it as easily as possible.
	In the 2015 issue of the Mind and Hand Book, the Help Seeking Practice section regarding prohibited substances was changed to resemble the Good Samaritan Policy of alcohol-related emergencies. But, instead of the broad wording designed to assure students that calling for help in an alcohol related emergency is safe, the book states that each drug related emergency will be handled on a case by case basis. The specific sentence in the Mind and Hand Book reads: “Each incident will be reviewed to determine if the situation warrants additional administrative or disciplinary action.” While students understand that strict laws control many substances prohibited by MIT, many are still frustrated with the failure of this policy to communicate where MIT draws the line. “I know people who have not called the police specifically because of this policy,” says an MIT senior, referring to the old drug policy. “This new policy doesn’t really help,” says one MIT sophomore, “because a student who is unsure if they will get in trouble won’t call for help.” 
	Clearly, MIT must comply with state and federal laws prohibiting the possession and sale of such substances, but the ban on “facilitation of the use” of prohibited substance still remains vague. In addition, the statement “MIT prohibits persons from permitting the use of prohibited substances, as noted in this policy, in one’s residence” could justify an investigation by the Committee on Discipline, and could further deter students from calling for help in an emergency. In order to get answers to some of these questions, I sat down with Don Camelio, director of MIT’s office of Community Development and Substance Abuse, who championed the alcohol Good Samaritan Policy in 2013. TK, interview with Mr. Camelio, scheduled 10/07/2015.
	Hopefully, this will clear up some of the confusion surrounding the new Good Samaritan Policy for prohibited substance, allowing students to be more aware of the response if they call for help.
