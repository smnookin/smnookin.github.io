The newsroom is in flux in this new, digital age. Reporters are having to contend with the emergent values of “immediacy, interactivity, and participation,” and new roles and workflows often find themselves at odds with the traditions of the daily print newspaper. At least, this is what Nikki Usher wants you to get from her book, “[Making News at The New York Times](https://www.press.umich.edu/7137512/making_news_at_the_new_york_times),” an in-depth look at the patterns of the digital-age newsroom at one of the nation’s top newspapers.

This book is the result of five months spent in the newsroom at _The Times_, research that was conducted to gather material for Usher’s doctoral dissertation. True to its origins, the book reads like an academic paper - often overly analytical and dry. At times, the writing could even be compared to that of a high-school research paper artificially padded to reach the word count – Usher returns again and again to the same points in her analysis, constantly looking for new ways to restate the same conclusions.

Usher starts by building the setting for her research, offering a picture of an industry that’s struggling to redefine itself in the digital age – and of a newspaper that, despite (or perhaps because of) its status as the “leading online newspaper in the world,” was still struggling at times to find its footing. “A look at newsmaking in the digital age,” writes Usher, “is a reminder that, at _The New York Times_, no one has quite figured out what it means to do newswork predictably or comfortably and that new news routines are still being crafted.”

For the most part, Usher’s role is that of an observer. She aims to present the newsroom as it is, now, by demonstrating how new values are emerging and painting a picture of how reporters and executives are reacting to them. Her account of the role of participation in later chapters of the book is then all the more jarring, as she presents an opinionated view not just of what participation in the newsroom is like now, but how she thinks it should be (spoiler: not at all how it is). In other cases we see how the contested nature of modern values plays out in real time, but here it seems at times that she’s the only one contesting it, taking entire paragraphs to describe her “ideal world” of participation in the newsroom.

Wandering from snapshots of Page One meetings (where the paper’s top editors “decide what news is most important to the world”) to moments shadowing reporters as they go about the daily work of journalism, Usher always brings the discussion back to her central thesis – the emerging values of “immediacy, interactivity, and participation,” an idea that effectively weaves together the many points of her research, but also a somewhat tired refrain that finds its way into practically every other paragraph in the book.

Anecdotes of life in the newsroom are where the book is at its best, presenting a strong look into the rhythms of modern journalism. An entire chapter is devoted to a series of illustrative day-in-the-life stories following three reporters on three days at _The Times_ – Usher’s account of Nick Bilton, a lead tech blogger, on the day of the iPad’s release is written in a fast-paced tone that gives the reader a real sense of what it was like and what immediate journalism means to _The Times_. And the vignettes she opens each chapter with are carefully tuned to provide insight into the topics at hand, such as an account of the Daily Show’s satirical “investigation into ‘why the last of a dying breed prefers aged news to real news.’”

Despite the interesting anecdotes, however, Usher rarely goes beyond a surface characterization of the newsroom’s actors. Her description of financial reporter Graham Bowley as “a sandy-haired, middle-aged Brit” stands out as nearly the only physical description in a book that seems to want to focus on the people. For the most part, the characters are only examined to the extent that they can further her central point, but Usher can’t seem to commit to that and instead regularly brings in details that will only get dropped a few paragraphs later.

Usher’s book presents an examination of _The Times_ in the digital age, as the paper and its staff learn what it means to report the news in modern times. Usher’s five months in the newsroom lend the book many fascinating anecdotes, but this only makes the analysis feel even more dry and forced in comparison. Clumsy writing and indecision about how best to tell the newsroom’s story hurt the book further. Usher could have spent a lot less time analyzing, and more time on the anecdotes that already serve as strong demonstrations of her central thesis, and come out with a book that was much more enjoyable. Nonetheless, she does present a clear picture of a newsroom in flux, and of the journalists who “felt pressure to adapt to the digital age, […] out of a felt demand to keep up or be left behind as _The Times_ moved ahead online.”
