Sliding 16 ice cubes evenly into 4 cups while dodging obstacles like ladybugs and plastic straws makes learning number partitioning easy, even for three year olds. To pour and slurp an equal amount of juice in each cup, two preschoolers take turns tapping the plastic, kid proof iPad screen. Lemonade, produced by WGBH Digital Kids for the Next Generation Preschool Math project, is only one of many games for early childhood education presented at the Early Childhood Education Race to the Top Leadership Conference held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on October 23rd. 

Tom Weber, the Commissioner of Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care, which launched in 2005 as the first independent department in the nation to focus on this population of children, stressed the importance of closing the achievement gap early, which begins at 1-2 years of age, rather than in kindergarten or first grade. “The return on investment is incomparable. Studies routinely place 10 to 18 dollars on each dollar spent on early childhood education.” Matthew Malone, Secretary of Education, agreed. “Early single dollar we don’t invest in early childhood is a waste of money.”

While speakers urged the community of educational leaders to continue to invest in early childhood education as part of Massachusetts $50 million Race to the Top initiative, the conference also raised significant attention to the growing trend of media and technology reaching our kids at a younger and younger age. Sesame Street, for example, which once held a target audience of 3-5 years old, is now watched by children as young as 18 months of age. 

The growing role of media in the critical developmental phase of children concerns some experts, such as Dr. Michael Rich, Director of the Center on Media and Child Health at the Boston Children’s Hospital, who calls himself a  “mediatrician.” At birth, we have the least developed brain as compared to any other animal. However, during the first few years of life, our brain rapidly develops in response to our environment, pruning away billions of unused synapses and giving away no neural circuitry unless our brains need it. The results are smart, resilient, creative and imaginative creatures. As young children also learn from socialization as well as their environments, Dr. Rich advises educators on providing children with healthy “media diets.”

Attracting leaders in all fields of early childhood expertise, the most popular celebrities at the conference were not local politicians, radio hosts, or school leaders but Curious George and Peep, an inflated yellow bird, two iconic characters from WGBH’s kids programming, who now appear not only on TV but children’s games, mobile apps and tablets. Unlike the effects of television, which have been studied for decades, the effects of technology on the generation of “digital natives,” those who grow up never knowing a world without media, are so new that researchers don’t even know its impact yet.  

In order to prepare our kids for the 21st century in an age, we must harness rather than ignore the technological changes in our society and in our classrooms, encouraging creative thinking through technology, not just finding “right answers, but really interesting answers.” A child writing numbers on an iPad gains no more additional value than the child who scratches numbers in chalk on an old slate, and in fact, will lose the tactical experience of the smell of the wood, sound of her own writing, or feel of the powder.

We are at the cusp of a new movement in which technology will not only become more ubiquitous and pervasive but also reach younger audiences, and as “digital immigrants,” if we can’t beat ‘em, then might as well join ‘em. However, keeping in mind our responsibilities to our next generation, Marisa Wolsky, executive producer of children’s programming at WGBH reminds us that when providing our kids with digital content, to not leave them hungry by feeding them “empty calories.”
