![](http://d1wvharlsiyzfl.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/5777ddcab3da704f8638e61dff539732.png)On August 31, the the MIT chapter of [Lambda Chi Alpha](http://web.mit.edu/lca/) was hosting one of the first parties of the year. As lasers pulsed, a thumping beat filled a room on the house's third floor. Freshmen eager to taste the college party scene were in abundance, as were students from other schools in the area. 

Then, in an instant, a woman from Northeastern University tumbled out of a window of the fraternity's historic home on Bay State Road in Boston and onto the ground below. She was [rushed to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/01/student-falls-from-mit-fraternity-window/BBj1YiwViY44GqiCuE6muI/story.html) with what police later described as "non-life threatening injuries." 

For the MIT Greek community, this was yet another in a series of high-profile mishaps that put local fraternities in a harsh light. (Almost exactly a year earlier, [a freshman fell four stories through a skylight](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/09/11/teen-falls-four-stories-through-skylight-mit-frat-house/IDwApg9xpBEbSwHp3yRjUM/story.html) from the roof of [Phi Sigma Kappa](http://phisig.mit.edu/), another MIT frat located in Boston.)
After this summer's accident, Lambda Chi Alpha brothers refused to talk to local and national media, including _The Tech_ and _The Boston Globe_. Now, for this first time, a member of the fraternity is speaking about the incident on the record.

“This was a freak accident and could have happened to anybody in any building,” said Jonah Hessels (’16), Lambda Chi Alpha's alumni relations chair. “We’re not sure how she fell."

Hessels disagrees with MIT's and the LCA's national organization to suspend the MIT frat. “It could have happened to anybody, and we were just very unlucky,” he said. “I don’t think LCA should be held responsible.”

What's more, Hessels said, it's almost certain the window was not opened by a member of the fraternity. “Every brother knows that those windows stay closed during parties and would not open them. When I went in to the dance floor a couple minutes before it all happened, the windows were closed,” he said. A female MIT undergrad who asked that her name not be used supported Hessels' account. “I heard from other students that the girl who fell actually opened the window because it got so hot,” she said. 

There also appears to be confusion about whether grates or screens that could prevent people from falling out windows violates Boston's fire code. Representatives of the Boston Fire department were unable to be reached to comment.

Haldun Anil, the president of the Interfraternal Council (IFC) and brother of Theta Chi fraternity, said he's thinks that's the case. “I’ve heard that grates aren’t allowed because it is against fire code and I have no idea about the screens," he said. "But none of this is official knowledge. ... The fire code and building code and city code is extremely complicated. We have to employ a code consultant to help figure it out." 

LCA's suspension, and an MIT-wide ban on parties, had to do with more than just the woman's fall. When she arrived at the hospital, it was discovered that she was intoxicated. At the time, fraternities were participating in rush, which MIT requires to be dry. The Boston Globe later reported that students at the party who saw the woman fall were not drinking and were not aware of any alcohol being served that night. “It was a dry party and we followed all the rules set forth from MIT and Boston. We could not have done anything to prevent this,” said Hessels. Mr. Anil said that he is not aware of how well LCA followed risk management procedure that night, as the investigation into their party practices by a committee of MIT Division of Student Life employees is ongoing. However, he did also echo Hessels’ earlier sentiment that “What happened at LCA could conceivably happen anywhere… at any fraternity or residential house.”

As for the party ban applying to all MIT fraternities, sororities, and other living groups, Hessels said, “If [MIT] wants to sanction LCA, that is fair because it did happen at our place and they need to check that we’re using safe practices. Punishing every other fraternity is unjust.” Anil says MIT did not initiate the occupancy restrictions. Boston placed blanket sanctions over all MIT Frats, Sororities and Living Groups (FSILGs) in Boston, and MIT extended them over Brookline and Cambridge in order to keep the rush process fair between frats on either side of the river. Anil said that he also does not agree with Boston’s policy of treating all MIT FSILG’s as the same, because they “are all essentially independent organizations.” Boston officials may have difficulties empathizing with MIT groups because they only experience instances where risk management fails, not the countless more instances where they succeed. Further complicating the situation is the national attention on hazing, sexual assault,  and alcohol abuse at fraternities and sororities. 

“There has been a common misconception amongst students that when these party bans are instated, MIT officials are to blame,” Anil said. “I have been consistently impressed with how they handle things like this. They really care and want to help us with this situation. They want it resolved almost as much as we do.” 

It is unclear what the sanctions will mean for LCA in the long run. It will feel the immediate effects, having been forbidden from taking a pledge class this year. “This has horribly affected brotherhood. Morale is low and people just don't want to be in the fraternity anymore. MIT is grueling and tough and if we are not free to blow off steam on the weekends there will be a lot of negative effects,” said Hessels.

Regardless of the circumstance of the incident, Anil says, “We just can’t afford to have this repeat itself again.”
