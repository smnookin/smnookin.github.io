“This was a freak accident and could have happened to anybody in any building,” said Jonah Hessels (’16), the Lambda Chi Alpha Alumni Relations chair. Hessels is the first brother willing to make a statement concerning the evening of August 30th. Until now, all brothers have declined to comment to The Tech, The Boston Globe, and any other online or print publication.

A female Northeastern student was dancing to the thumping beat near a window as lasers pulsed and lights flickered at a Rush event filled with freshmen eager to taste the college party scene. Moments later, she tumbled from that third story window, landing on a one story garage. She was then rushed to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center where it was discovered that she suffered minor injuries, according to The Boston Globe.

“We’re not sure how she fell,” said Hessels.

The fraternity is under suspension by both MIT and LCA Nationals, and a party ban has been reinstated on all MIT fraternities and sororities. 

“It could have happened to anybody, and we were just very unlucky,” Hessels said.
“I don’t think LCA should be held responsible.”

Mr. Hessels was not on the dance floor when the event occurred. He and about 10 other friends were hanging out in his room to enjoy the air conditioning when another brother ran in to tell him about the fall. 

“Every brother knows that those windows stay closed during parties and would not open them. When I went in to the dance floor a couple minutes before it all happened, the windows were closed,” Hessels said. The LCA house, a former home of a Massachusetts governor and US Senator, is about 100 years old, with some renovations. Like many ivy adorned historic homes in Back Bay, the LCA house lacks central air-conditioning. A female student, who prefers to remain anonymous, said, “I heard from other students that the girl who fell actually opened the window because it got so hot.” Mr. Hessels said that grates or screens preventing people falling through the windows violates fire code. Representatives of the Boston Fire department were unable to be reached to comment.

“I’ve heard that grates aren’t allowed because it is against fire code and I have no idea about the screens, but none of this is official knowledge,” said Haldun Anil, president of the Interfraternal Council (IFC) and brother of Theta Chi fraternity. “If there is anything I have learned it is that the fire code and building code and city code is extremely complicated. We (Theta Chi) have to employ a code consultant to help figure it out,” said Mr. Anil. The IFC, the governing body of all fraternities on campus, has been working closely with MIT administrators to address the current status of the occupancy rules and party bans. 


Another issue that prompted LCA’s suspension was the discovery that the woman who fell was intoxicated. At the time, fraternities were participating in rush, which MIT requires to be dry. The Boston Globe reported that students at the party who saw the woman fall were not drinking and were not aware of any alcohol being served that night. “It was a dry party and we followed all the rules set forth from MIT and Boston. We could not have done anything to prevent this,” said Hessels. Mr. Anil said that he is not aware of how well LCA followed risk management procedure that night, as the investigation into their party practices by a committee of MIT Division of Student Life employees is ongoing. However, he did also echo Hessels’ earlier sentiment that “What happened at LCA could conceivably happen anywhere… at any fraternity or residential house.”

As for the party ban applying to all MIT fraternities, sororities, and ILG’s, Hessels said, “If [MIT] wants to sanction LCA, that is fair because it did happen at our place and they need to check that we’re using safe practices. Punishing every other fraternity is unjust.” Mr. Anil says MIT did not initiate the occupancy restrictions. Boston placed blanket sanctions over all MIT Frats, Sororities and Living Groups (FSILGs) in Boston, and MIT extended them over Brookline and Cambridge in order to keep the rush process fair between frats on either side of the river. Anil said that he also does not agree with Boston’s policy of treating all MIT FSILG’s as the same, because they “are all essentially independent organizations.” Boston officials may have difficulties empathizing with MIT groups because they only experience instances where risk management fails, not the countless more instances where they succeed. Further to Boston’s credit, there has been a slew of backlash nationally against fraternities regarding sexual assault and alcohol abuse. They may feel the need to take a firm stance against MIT fraternities as a result.

There is a precedent for MIT and Boston placing blanket sanctions on all FSILGs in response to accidents occurring at one house. Almost exactly a year before the incident at LCA, a MIT freshman fell through the skylight at his fraternity, sustaining minor injuries, leading MIT and Boston to forbid parties and large gatherings. “There has been a common misconception amongst students that when these party bans are instated, MIT officials are to blame,” said Mr. Anil.“I have been consistently impressed with how they handle things like this. They really care and want to help us with this situation. They want it resolved almost as much as we do.” 

It is unclear what the sanctions will mean for LCA in the long run. They feel the immediate effects, having been forbidden from taking a pledge class this year. “This has horribly affected brotherhood. Morale is low and people just don't want to be in the fraternity anymore. MIT is grueling and tough and if we are not free to blow off steam on the weekends there will be a lot of negative effects,” said Hessels.

Regardless of the circumstance of the incident, Anil says, “We just can’t afford to have this repeat itself again.”
