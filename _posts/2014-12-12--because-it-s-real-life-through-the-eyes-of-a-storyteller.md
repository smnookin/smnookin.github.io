MIT’s Building 14 is a beige brick building with the Hayden Library facing the banks of the Charles River in the front; in the back are offices of professors from several humanities departments, including Comparative Media Studies/Writing, Global Studies and Languages, and Literature. On the fourth floor, the frosted-glass door of one of the offices is covered by a collage of African women dressed in tribal clothing and adorned with jewelry; in almost every picture, the women’s eyes stare directly at the camera. Inside the office, a lamp accents a batik painting hanging over the desk, and framed prints of the singers Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday adorn the walls. Behind the desk sits Helen Elaine Lee, a fiction writer and creative writing professor. Lee has frizzy black and gray hair and often wears long earrings, and the corners of her eyes are crinkled in a perpetual smile. 

At 12:50 p.m., Lee packs up and heads to the classroom where she teaches “Writing and Reading Short Stories” twice a week. The small oval table soon overflows, and five of the thirteen students have to sit in the back of the room. For the next hour and a half, Lee leads a discussion of James Baldwin’s short story, “Sonny’s Blues.” That evening, she’ll work on her next book in her dining room/study. In a couple weeks she will head to a Boston prison, where she volunteers in a writing program for several months of the year. This was not the life she envisioned for herself thirty years ago, when she graduated from Harvard Law School.

_She points to a paragraph on the page. “What’s really amazing is this next section,” she says. “It’s the whole life journey.” As she reads out a passage, she looks up periodically, making eye contact with her students. Her voice fills the room. “Do you see what Baldwin’s done? He’s put the entire experience of life in one paragraph—messing up, stumbling, thinking you’ve found your way.” _

Lee’s parents, George and Dorothy Lee, met in the 1940s at Harvard, where George was attending the Law School and Dorothy would become the first black woman to receive a PhD in comparative literature.  George, who had attended segregated schools in Baltimore and served in the segregated army, would eventually become a criminal defense lawyer. But despite graduating with honors, he was unable to find a job practicing law in Boston. Instead, in 1949 he found work as a waiter in a country club—an experience that, according to Lee, ate away at him for the rest of his life. After that, George and Dorothy moved to Detroit, where Dorothy had grown up, in the hopes of finding work there through her family’s connections. 

As a child, Lee was indoctrinated into a religion of books. Dorothy was a passionate and “magical” teacher at University of Michigan-Dearborn, and guided Lee toward reading that encompassed global perspectives.  On Sunday afternoons, they would read and analyze poetry and stories by the authors like Dickinson, Keats, and Shakespeare.

The Lee household was profoundly influenced by the culture of storytelling, inspired by African American oral traditions passed down by Dorothy’s father, Victor. Although Victor died before Lee was born, his stories lived on through Dorothy’s scrapbooks and through his wife, whom Lee was named after. This is how Lee first heard many of the stories of her ancestors that would shape her sense of the world, such as the one about a slave who risked his life to teach other slaves how to read and write; or how Dorothy and her mother hid in the back seat on road trips while the light-skinned Victor, who often passed as being white, found lodging for the night. 

George was a different kind of storyteller, a gifted courtroom orator who also loved to read. (Once when he was sick in the hospital, he read a dictionary cover-to-cover.)  “Word-lovers,” said Lee, speaking of her family. “All of them.” In Detroit, George found work as a criminal defense lawyer, which profoundly influenced Lee’s future work on the stories of America’s prisoners and her leadership of prison writing programs through [PEN New England](http://www.pen-ne.org/). 

Lee attended Harvard College and majored in psychology and social relations. By the time she graduated, she had realized clinical psychology was not for her and applied to law school out of default. As important as literature was to her upbringing, she hadn’t found her voice as a writer. And she may never have, if she hadn’t realized after getting into Harvard Law School what a horrible mistake she had made. Finding herself miserable (she almost dropped out at one point), she found a way she could take literature classes and get partial credit at the law school. “I was desperate and hungry,” Lee said; she wrote a major third-year law school paper on the revolutionary nature of three Latin American poets. “I was moving away from law even before I graduated.”

_“This part—it speaks to how painful the process of making art is,” she says. She looks up at the students with a wry smile on her face. “You guys probably feel that with writing your own stories.” The students laugh. “Yeah, it’s not easy.”_

The 1980s were an historic time for black female writers. Alice Walker and Toni Morrison were both at the height of their fame and acclaim, and their books were regularly on the bestseller lists. “It really blew away the presumption at the time, which was that black people didn’t read or write complex literature,” Lee says. “And they certainly didn’t write literature white people read.”

It was in this environment that Lee wrote her first story while practicing in a corporate law firm in Chicago. She had moved there after graduating, but hated her job, and felt that the law firm was on the wrong side of ethical battles, like supporting companies with despicable environmental practices, and a “bastion of white male privilege,” which pretended to be a meritocracy while rewarding “apolitical (if not conservative), conventional, narrow-minded and one-dimensional” people. The story, called “Living Well,” about a man who sold his soul in a corporate law firm, was published in the Harvard Black Letter Journal in 1987. 

Lee quit her job and moved to Washington D.C. with her then-lover, Renee, with whom she was in a relationship for seven years. At the same time, she began thinking back to a story about her grandmother’s sister Dot, and Dot’s lover, Vee, which would become a fifty-year relationship. And while her family certainly did not condemn the lesbian relationship, she had noticed a general silence around it, inspiring her second story called “Silences.” “There are these things that we don’t talk about,” Lee says, who herself identifies with the categories of lesbian, queer, gay and bisexual. “And those are the things that really drive our lives. I’m sure I was working out my real-life relationship through the story too.” 

In D.C., Lee continued to practice law, moving from job-to-job on the Hill, in a liberal thinktank, in Human Health Services. Any spare time she got—evenings, weekends, late nights—she spent writing and attending workshop group meetings for artists and writers. In one of these meetings, she received feedback that “Silences” seemed like it wanted to be longer. This catalyzed the next two to three years, in which Lee slowly began to pull together common threads between this and other stories she had written, resulting in _The Serpent’s Gift_. The first time she sent out the partially-finished manuscript to publishers, there wasn’t any interest. But just as she was finishing it up, an editor from Atheneum Books (an independent publisher later bought by Scribner), who had passed it up the first time, reached out to her, claiming that he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about it. 

According to critics, the novel brought a new, refreshing perspective, while also conjuring the essence of Southern black novels before her. “She captures the cadences of the region, creating profound sympathy for the people about whom she writes,” said one review. The character of LaRue, based on Victor, Lee’s storytelling grandfather, provided a skeleton spanning fifty years of history as the narrative moved between four characters. “People probably think it’s unique because it tells a lesbian story, it’s grounded in the illegal abortion era, and it breaks a lot of those silences,” Lee said. “And I’m always so hungry of depictions of black people that have any complexity at all.”

Nine years after moving to D.C., Lee heard about a creative writing lecturer position at MIT. She had never envisioned going back to Cambridge after school, but here was a job that would allow her the ability to work on what she truly loved and was passionate about. With a book under her belt, she leapt at the chance, packed up in D.C. and moved to Cambridge. 

The lecturer position was only for a year, but it turned into a writer-in-residence and then a tenure-track position. Today she has been at MIT for nineteen years.

_She tells them to turn to page 95, and reads a passage about Sonny and the “torment” of creating music with the piano. “You can really say the same thing about writing,” she tells the class. “You take the chaos and the roar and shape it into something—that’s what all writing does. And then it’s shared.”_

Having her true passion integrated into daily life was a relief to Lee. Plus MIT students were imaginative, creative and deeply analytical. There were also those students whose dedication to writing truly motivated her, like sophomore Vincent Anioke, who is currently taking her class. Anioke not only received personal feedback on his writing, but a personal note from Lee asking about whether he was having any personal struggles at MIT and encouraging him to talk to her at any time. Senior Ishwarya Ananthabhotla, adds that Lee really cares about the “story behind the story” and works to offer her own experiences to help students convey that. 

Still, teaching at MIT, one of the world’s prominent technical institutions, had challenges she had never predicted. “Humanities are marginalized at MIT,” Lee said. “It’s just not a thrust of the institution.” Once she gave a free-write assignment, and one student came back with a piece about how the Humanities, Arts, and Social Science requirement at MIT was an unfortunate part of life there. Another time, when Lee applied to be a housemaster at a graduate dorm, proposing to expand humanities-related experiences, she was essentially told that the students wanted a technical housemaster. “The message seemed to be, ‘we don’t want to be expanded,’” she said. 

Boston itself presented its own challenges. “I used to say I wanted somewhere warmer, cheaper, and blacker,” she said, laughing wryly. “Somewhere with different race politics. Boston is a hard place to make community. Everyone’s really driven and wrapped up in their own things.” There were several times Lee considered leaving MIT and Boston, but she was now a single-mother by choice—she had her son through donor-insemination—and her mother had moved to help her out, so it just didn’t make sense. Plus, she had found a different force drawing her to the area: exploring New England’s prisons.

_Sunlight streams through the window. “Okay, so according to Baldwin, there’s suffering.” She says. “But what do we do about it? What is the light?” The students are silent and start fidgeting, but she continues to push them to think. “It’s the words, isn’t it?” A sense vulnerability hangs on each word in her gravelly voice. “It’s spreading a story. Communication makes a bridge between us—that is the light in the darkness. And that is our hope for redemption.” _

From her father’s work in criminal defense, Lee knew that everyone often had a complicated story, and that opportunities and resources are not the same for everyone. “There was also a deep sense of the relationship between legal enforcement and racial consciousness for us,” said Lee. “But I needed to earn the right to tell this story.” So in 2001, she began volunteering her time in a year-long experiment at South Bay, the Suffolk County House of Correction, which provided men who had been in and out of prisons, often with addiction at the root of their problems, with programs like meditation, storytelling and acting to orchestrate healing.  

Lee soon learned to be subtle with institutions themselves, who were worried about exposés on the prison system. But she would always be up front with the prisoners, who were usually eager to tell her their stories. “They feel invisible, like they live in another universe, the other America,” she said. “And they’re eager to see themselves depicted with complexity and humanity.”

Her work haunted her, got under her skin and made her uncomfortable with the dichotomy of the privileges of her life at MIT with the prisons. These were people who could pour themselves into telling and writing harrowing stories of suffering. They were compassionate people, who asked after her son (“how’s the little man doing?”) and who told her that the story she had written about them in The New York Times was “smooth.”

Even after Lee had all the material she needed to publish several short stories and write a novel, she still found herself drawn to volunteering year after year. But what she hadn’t expected was the difficulty she would have in finding someone to publish the novel. Every publisher would tell her that the manuscript was beautifully written, but would then say they didn’t really know who its audience. “I think that’s a question that people of color have to answer more,” she said. “I would hope the audience would be humans, and humans who care about the suffering of other humans.”

It was a problem she hadn’t really faced much with _The Serpent’s Gift_ or her second book, _Water Marked_, published by Scribner who bought Atheneum, which was a closer exploration of two sisters and family stories. She had certainly received ignorant comments from publishers like, “We already have a black book this season,” or Americana interpretations that Lee called a “folksy, quaint little look at things.” But after that, the ride was fairly smooth sailing. Perhaps it was because _The Serpent’s Gift_, despite dealing with heavier topics, had a certain levity to it. “The prison stories are dark and disturbing,” she said. “And it’s where so many of my people end up finding themselves. So it means a lot to me, and it’s really heartbroken to be told no.”

Junot Diaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Lee’s colleague in MIT’s Writing department, echoes these thoughts. “Helen is writing about one of the foundational silences in our society.  She is humanizing the people we are told not to think about…with towering compassion and terrifying honesty.” Likening it t_o th_e Wire, a TV show that examines Baltimore’s hidden social issues, he said that this was the kind of narrative no one is trying to hear; such a novel would have been published at a time before publishers were part of corporate multinationals. “Now publishers want younger and hipper,” Diaz said. “The truth is neither.”

According to Lee, the doors that had opened in the 1980s for black female writers in the publishing world seem to have somewhat closed since then, and her heart now is in a place that people don’t seem to want to know about. But as a woman of color, who also identifies with multiple sexual orientations, that sense of being an outsider was something she had felt since growing up in a primarily black neighborhood, from the minute she stepped on the bus that would take her to a predominantly white, suburban private school. “I was at once part of two worlds, and yet part of neither,” she said.  It was this bicultural identity that caused her “the most pain, while also giving me the deepest source of strength.” 

Today, Lee feels strongly about her responsibilities at an institution like MIT to bring opportunities to students of color, speak out on committees, bring writers that are broader-minded, and force a conversation. Now she is thinking about her next book portraying someone like her—a single mother, a big city, academia, being an outsider, and “just assumptions we make about privilege and how little access people have to it.”
“It’s not a tragedy or a crisis,” she said. “But like W.E.B. DuBois says, it’s the ‘twoness’ we all feel.”

_“Why do you think this story is called ‘Sonny’s Blues?’” she asks. She listens to a few of the students’ answers, acknowledging their thoughts, pushing them to elaborate, before offering her own thoughts. “The brothers move from silence to sound,” she says after a pause. “And the blues they play tell us about suffering, but also about triumph. You know, ‘Here I am having survived to tell the tale.’” She stops and thinks. “Hey, maybe we are reading a happy story this semester!” The students laugh, clearly remembering a previous joke._

_“Yeah, maybe it’s as happy as it gets,” she says, her voice softening, “because it’s real.”_
