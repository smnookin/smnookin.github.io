## Getting People to Make Stuff

Nadeem Mazen zips around snapping photos and greeting guests, while his buddy Ali Mohammad carefully prepares the coffee. The two guys look like brothers with their thick beards, dark eyes, and black curly hair, which Nadeem wears in in a slick ponytail and Ali sports in an untamed ‘fro, small black-framed glasses buried in the depths. While Nadeem wears a sleek blazer and skinny tie, Ali sports a white T-shirt and khakis.

The two friends, now in their early thirties, became business partners back in the spring of 2012 when they opened [danger!awesome](http://dangerawesome.co/), an open-access workshop in Cambridge that provides laser-cutting and 3-D printing services. Now they’re christening a second, much larger, underground space just around the corner in Central Square. 

The inaugural shop is stocked with three laser-cutters and two small 3-D printers, while the new shop houses a massive, four-by-eight foot CNC router—a computer-controlled machine that can cut doors and other large slabs of wood with a laser. It took seven men and a crane to move it off the truck and downstairs.
 
Danger!awesome offers a little bit of everything—community workshops, built-to-order fabrication services, membership programs and a retail store—which makes it difficult to pinpoint. Even Ali and Nadeem have trouble encapsulating their vision in just one sentence. Basically, Ali says, it boils down to: “Get people to make stuff.” More specifically, they hope danger!awesome will get everyone to make stuff, not just professional engineers and designers. 

“I think there’s something deeply fulfilling about making something. I have this idea that tool building is something that we do instinctively. It’s like music, language and dance,” Ali says. “People have a lot of experience with music and language, but people don’t often do anything to make something. They don’t build things. That’s why we’re here. To give people that fulfillment.”

And that’s why, in addition to having technicians fulfill orders like laser-etched pint glasses, the shop also offers a membership program to customers who want to use the laser-cutters themselves.

After completing the $125 one-time training session, the membership fees are fairly cheap. Unlike other member-based workshops, like [TechShop](http://techshop.ws/), or universities like MIT, danger!awesome charges only three dollars per minute spent using the laser cutter itself, not the design software that’s synced up to the machine. Though the fee may sound steep to some, the savings add up. Creating and formatting the image on the computer can take hours, but once it’s sent to the machine, the blazing blue laser cuts in mere seconds or minutes. 

Ali and Nadeem’s efforts to engage the community with high-tech tools seem to be working so far, at least to some extent. I swung by the main shop on a weeknight, and kids ranging from eight to sixteen were coming in for a laser-cutting class. And when I stopped in for some demos on a Saturday night, one member was quietly perfecting his designs on the computer, free of charge. To make the process even more affordable, he and other members bring their own materials to cut and etch with the lasers, like wood, leather and acrylic.

Danger!awesome and its small team actually have so many supporters that they had to host two opening nights for the new space, which was funded with a $42,727 donation from 727 backers on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nadeemtron/dangerawesome-a-high-tech-hands-on-community-maker). And to think, it was the vision of dancing toasts that started it all. 

## Dancing Toasts

Nadeem and Ali were hungry. Like, really hungry. They were fasting for Ramadan and passing the afternoon in Ali’s office talking about food—specifically, dancing toasts. 

“It’s just all you think about at a certain part of the day,” says Ali, who was pursuing a graduate degree in computational linguistics at the time. They mused about the famous [Virgin Mary grilled cheese](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2004/11/the_28k_sandwich_that_grew_no_mold.html) that sold for $28,000 on eBay and the [transcendent toaster kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC-SdzjxzUE) that conjures the image of Jesus with every slice. They thought, what if we did that with thousands of images? It’d be like a flipbook, but instead of paper they’d use stop-motion video and crispy bread, one image per slice.     

That food-deprived conversation was on a Thursday back in 2009. The following Tuesday, Nadeem came back to Ali’s office in MIT’s Suess-like Stata Center and said, “Hey man, do you have time for a conference call?” 

“Sure. Who are we talking to?” Ali asked.

“OK Go,” Nadeem said, referring to the alt-rock band known for dancing on treadmills in their video [“Here It Goes Again.”](%E2%80%9CHere It Goes Again.%E2%80%9D)

And just like that they were talking on the phone with Damian Kalush, lead singer of the Grammy-award-winning band. Nadeem, who was in a MIT biological engineering graduate program, had emailed him the idea through a friend of a friend. “That’s the kind of guy he is—pretty aggressive,” says Ali, sitting in the new workshop where three seven-foot-tall LiteBrites serve as the backdrop.

“We just thought it would be really funny if we did a whole bunch of toasts and did stop-motion—made a video with it. We didn’t really have an idea of how it would look or even how you would do it. It was just an idea,” Ali says. “I really have to give Nadeem credit, because he took it and he ran with it.”

It turned out that Kalush wanted to run with it too, but didn’t quite understand what “it” was. He kept saying he needed a visual reference—really see it. So Ali and Nadeem took to the highly equipped labs in the depths of MIT to play with laser cutters.

They’d independently taught themselves to use the box-shaped machines that resemble copier machines. Once you format the design in the computer software and select the strength of the laser (the hard part), you position the material under the laser, close the lid, and press “start.” The duo experimented with loaves of bread until they perfected the routine. They’d etch each image into a soft slice of white bread, pop it into a cheap toaster until it reached a golden brown, and then film the entire sequence of toasts using stop-motion video. 

Because Nadeem and Ali were MIT grad students, they had access to the university’s laser cutters. But that didn’t mean they had permission to use them for their own extracurricular projects. 

“I don’t know what the professors would have done if they saw us walking into the laser cutting room with loaves of bread,” Ali says. To avoid scolding, the two buddies would sneak into the lab in the middle of the night when no one was there. Why didn’t they just ask for permission? “The MIT policy is asking for forgiveness,” Ali says with a deep belly laugh. 

Their stealth paid off. The band loved the short prototypes and secured a sponsorship to cover the cost of the three $30,000 laser cutters needed to produce the video. Ali and Nadeem helped pick the song “Last Leaf,” not for any poetic reasons, but because it was the shortest song on the album, requiring the least amount of bread. 

After nearly a year of collaborative design with OK Go and multiple animators, Ali and Nadeem were left with only one week to actually make the video—a task they’d initially allotted a few months. Luckily, they were able to secure hundreds of loaves of bread from the nearby Pepperidge Farm surplus store, which sells near-expiration products in bulk. They also picked up bags of cheap Milano cookies to fuel their eighteen-hour workdays.

Eight sleep-deprived days, 2,430 slices of bread, and countless cookies later, the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkYfB1C0Zgc) was posted on YouTube. It immediately went viral. A couple years later, Ali and Nadeem opened danger!awesome—a career move neither had anticipated when they first met at MIT.

## The Prodigy

Nadeem and Ali met through MIT’s Muslim Student Association (MSA) back in 2002. Nadeem had just started undergrad and Ali was starting his doctoral program in computational linguistics. You might think it’s a bit odd for a twenty-something doc student to be hanging around with a freshman, but here’s the thing: they were both eighteen. Though you won’t hear it from him, Ali’s sort of a prodigy. His wife Nadia explains that he graduated high school at the age of 14 then quadruple-majored in physics, math, computer science and computer engineering at Kansas State. 

“I just started early,” he mumbles as she brags, sitting in the new danger!awesome workshop.

Ali was born in Baltimore but grew up in Colorado before heading off to college in Kansas. He was always making random things with hammers and saws—nothing like the high-tech machines he uses now. And he’d often get in trouble with his mom for taking things apart. 

“I remember I took apart a laptop, and every square inch of this pretty big room was parts—just little pieces everywhere,” Ali says, a fly circling his mass of curls.

Looking around danger!awesome’s new workshop, it doesn’t appear that he’s grown out of the habit. Hunks of plywood, old doors, broken pots, and disassembled electronics cover the massive basement. It feels like a mad scientist’s lab, but one stocked with wood and wires instead of potions and petri dishes. 

I visited the new space two nights before the grand opening, and instead of cleaning up, Ali and his friend, Ethan Miller, were hard at work building a steamer for cappuccinos and lattes. "This is bullshit,” Ali says pointing to a deconstructed espresso machine on the table. “This shouldn't be $1,800. It has a good boiler but it only has one, and its job is to both produce steam and water for the espresso machine. And I don't think it does a good job."

“Nah,” says Ethan, a barista who’s studied coffee making for seven years.  

They inserted a better steam wand from a different espresso machine into a wooden case that they carved with laser cutter, “d!a” logo included. Next, they have to put in the wiring, connect the boiler to the steam wand, and bring in water from the outside. This steamer would just be for milk, but the plan is to build an espresso machine too. “I know we can do a better job,” Ali says.
![ali coffee edited.png](/_posts/ali coffee edited.png)

“Ali’s skills blow my mind,” says Dariush Nejad, danger!awesome’s Director of Operations. "He's always working on something cool, from making a soda rig to making a mini-arcade to perfecting a cappuccino. To say Ali likes coffee is an understatement.”

The irony is that Ali is actually pretty sensitive to caffeine. “If I have more than three cups of coffee a day, I’m just vibrating,” he says.

Ali was finishing up his doctoral thesis and teaching at MIT when he and Nadeem made the toast video in 2010. Google recruited him soon after, though he hadn’t yet defended his thesis or graduated. He worked there up until six months ago when he left to focus on danger!awesome, but he still does some contractual projects.

Moving forward, Nadeem hopes they can leverage Ali’s technical expertise even more to give danger!awesome a competitive edge. “He could be a seven-figure programmer if he wanted to be,” Nadeem says. “So just giving him the space to step back from the day-to-day to design systems, programs and drivers.” According to Nadia, Ali’s been offered corporate gigs, but hasn’t taken the bait. “He wants to test things out and spread his wings,” she says.

Nadia first spoke with Ali in September 2011 when she interviewed him and Nadeem by phone for a freelance article about the OK Go video. Nadia, who’s completed law school and is currently studying peace and conflict at UMass Lowell, also works as an editor for [altmuslimah](http://www.altmuslimah.com/), a website featuring stories and commentary on gender in Islam. Because of their similar Muslim backgrounds and outlooks on life, she and Ali kept in touch through Facebook after the interview. Growing up in mostly Christian communities, it was uncommon for either of them to find that type of connection. 

Nadia has dark, straight hair and a makeup-free, olive complexion that would make any woman envious. A tiny silver stud adorns her nose. Generally soft-spoken, she explains that she’s always been anxious about meeting people and had reached a point in life where she was a bit cynical about relationships. “Then you meet somebody who's really all the things you were looking for but didn't know, and you just kind of feel at peace,” she says.

Nadia and Ali finally met in person in October 2012 and got married seven months later. “Muslims who are practicing look at someone they're dating as a prospective spouse,” explains Nadia, briefly interrupted by Ali asking if we’d like any food from Chipotle. Not surprisingly, Ali designed and made their intricate wedding invitations with one of the danger!awesome’s laser cutters. 
![ali litebrite biggest.png](/_posts/ali litebrite biggest.png)

The couple was hanging out in the new workshop late one night, and Nadia called out to Ali in a hopeful voice. “I thought, okay, she’s going to tell me it’s time to go home,” Ali says. Instead, she asked to test out the laser cutter with neoprene, the synthetic rubber used in wetsuits that’s beginning to appear in high fashion, Nadia explains.

“I was so excited,” says Ali, beaming at her. 

Though Ali can be more reserved when around Nadeem, he’s an extrovert nonetheless, Dariush says. “He’s like a big, smart teddy bear,” says Nick Paige, a danger!awesome designer.

## The Politician

“Nadeem is more the politician,” Nadia explains. “He’s good about getting people fired about things, and Ali is good about continuing that momentum.” The dynamic makes sense, given that Nadeem actually is a politician. He was elected to Cambridge City Council last November. He also co-founded and runs [Nimblebot](http://www.nimblebot.com/), an animation software startup that helps non-profits, the education sector, and new journalism make video advocacy more exciting and affordable. 

“From danger!awesome to Nimblebot across the street, up to city hall, it's like Nadeem-land,” Dariush says. “He's always flying around here.” Described as frenetic and high-energy by his employees, Nadeem is certainly hard to pin down on earth. I only talked with him in person for a couple minutes at the workshop opening. The rest of our sporadic conversations took place by phone.

Nadeem grew up in Andover, Massachusetts, and never really planned on being a politician or an entrepreneur. Instead, he thought he’d create robots.

As a public school student, he applied to the boarding school Phillips Academy on a whim and received a scholarship to attend. Early on, he had a unique experience with a teacher who pushed him to take harder and harder classes. 

In fact, Nadeem had taken so many advanced math and science courses that he could waive a year of credits at MIT, where he majored in biological and mechanical engineering. Instead of spending his senior year taking electives, he travelled to Cairo for his international affairs concentration, wrote a senior thesis, and created a video project. 

“I was a little bit under-guided and aimless in my undergrad career,” Nadeem says. “It ended up for the better, because I was able to ignore classes and just focus on community, society, policy, and development questions that were, to me, much more interesting.” He’d always felt there was a disconnect between his family’s emphasis on academic performance and a deep-seeded understanding that classwork doesn’t impact real exploration—though he hopes that’s changing with more hands-on learning in the classroom.

While Nadeem’s father paints and his mother sketches, he’s never really had the same free-hand skill. Instead, he started playing around with Flash animation and coding in his teens—a hobby that got him a job promoting Nintendo’s GameBoy Advanced when he was only eighteen. 
![nadeem camera small.png](/_posts/nadeem camera small.png)

After college graduation, he and three buddies decided to join the Mongolia Charity Rally, a drive from England to China to raise money for charity. Nadeem earned the $15,000 they needed for the trip through an animation job that only took him two days. 

“I haven't always been creative, but I've always been doing a lot of different things and some of those things became skills that I internalized,” he says.

After a year away from dreaded classrooms, Nadeem returned to MIT for a graduate program in biological engineering. He put in hundreds of hours on the Media Lab’s laser cutters quietly making and selling art, in addition to the animal pain research for his master’s. In fact, he created a mousetrap for medical research that’s nearly a hundredth of the cost of current enclosures. “If I wanted to go make a fortune right now, I could go help people test on animals cheaply,” says Nadeem (a most-of-the-time vegetarian who only eats meat if ethically raised or halal). “But I obviously would never want to do that.”

Nadeem actually started danger!awesome with Ali when he should’ve been writing his master’s thesis and continuing on to the doctoral program. But he firmly decided not to turn in his thesis or stay in biological engineering. “I was told by people around me, just submit anything and we'll approve it,” he says. “That was uncomfortable.”

He felt a similar discomfort when he started attending city meetings a few years ago for some of his own service projects. At one particularly disheartening City Council meeting, the councilors were antagonizing each other and ignoring two hours of public comments on the issue at hand. “The legislators didn’t hear it, didn’t reflect on it, didn’t talk about it, didn’t refer back to it,” Nadeem says.
![nadeem activism small.png](/_posts/nadeem activism small.png)

Nadeem gets why many people think there’s something a little off about government. “But it’s really just a need for new, efficient problem solving, creativity, innovation, openness, transparency in government,” he says. 

Nadeem never did get into robotics. Instead, he realized that, regardless of his job title, he’s meant to make things and solve problems. He’s tackled the problem of under-advocated issues at Nimblebot, community engagement with high-tech learning at danger!awesome, and community issues through City Council. 

“I'm just kind of one guy trifurcated trying to do three things, and I see the next step as figuring out how to make those things roll on their own while I focus on, ideally, one of them,” Nadeem says. He’s hoping that, as a result, his mid-thirties will be much saner.

## The Dynamic Duo

Despite being all over the map—of Cambridge, at least—Nadeem thoughtful in how he approaches projects, Dariush says. And when it comes to danger!awesome ventures, Nadeem’s got a solid partner in Ali. “They know their strengths and weaknesses, and they can counter-balance each other out,” Dariush says.

“One of us will work on the bottle neck and the other one will grab a bunch of stuff and jam it through,” Nadeem says. “I’m kind of trying to steer the ship and make it a bigger ship. There’s a lot of time when Ali is on the ground, running around filling gaps.”

Nadia doesn’t think either of them have many inhibitions. That’s probably why danger!awesome worked out the way it did. The scrappy pair created the start-up through their resources and know-how alone, Dariush says. 

After the OK Go music video, Nadeem and Ali stored the three laser cutters in a studio on Green Street, but were forced to move out when the landlord didn’t renew their lease in May 2011. “I had this image of a laser cutter in my living room,” Ali says. 

Nadeem called Ali about an open retail space around the corner from the Central Square T-stop. Though every shop in the space had failed to stay open for very long, it was kind of perfect for their three-by-two foot laser cutters that emit exhaust with every cut. Because the space is only one story tall, Ali and Nadeem could run a short exhaust pipe through the ceiling directly to the outside. 

The pair signed the lease and decided to turn their personal studio into a full-blown business. Ali and his younger sister came up with the name for the shop. They thought it would be funny if the place were so awesome that it’s dangerous. 

“I think people were concerned that we didn’t know what we were doing,” Ali says.

“They’re still concerned,” Nadia says quietly, laughing.

## Danger: Awesome Stuff Ahead

With their bright minds and prestigious degrees, Ali and Nadeem are clearly eligible for highly lucrative jobs. Instead, they’re committed to sharing the high-tech tools they’ve been privileged to use with people outside the four-block radius of MIT.

“The nice thing about laser cutters is that they’re really easy to use,” says Ali. One of the first things you learn in woodshop is that you can’t cut a straight line or right angles with a saw, so making a box is actually pretty complicated, he explains. “With the laser cutter, you just say cut a box, and it cuts a box.”

A few danger!awesome customers have been a bit more creative with the laser cutters. One man had technicians cut an enormous biohazard sign into his toilet seat. A female member cuts latex into dresses for Katy Perry and Pink, while a guy cuts it into gurneys used in organ transplants. The only materials the lasers can’t cut through are metal and stone; they can only etch the surfaces. 

And while people often ask for laser-cut tattoos, that’s one service danger!awesome doesn’t  provide—though they technically could. Lasers create a scar tissue tattoo, like a burn or brand. After seeing a laser accidentally catch fire and singe a piece of neon-pink plastic during a demo, I can see why. 
![sign at front danger awesome.png](/_posts/sign at front danger awesome.png)

In addition to the membership program, danger!awesome also hosts community workshops where people can learn to make specific products and walk out of the door with a tangible product in their hands, like leather masks or plastic rings. Since Ali always thought he’d become a professor one day, the workshops are his favorite part of the job.

Moving forward, Nadeem says danger!awesome could go in a couple different directions. Large makerspace chains, like TechShop, require millions of investment dollars for each new location and focus on elite makers, Nadeem says. 

Danger!awesome is much smaller, and Nadeem and Ali want to keep it that way. But they also want it to be everywhere. 
“We want to do for 3-D printing, design, and hands-on learning what Kinko’s did for simple access to printers,” says Nadeem. “What you really need is a place that brings it to the everyman, the everywoman. I want this to work for consumers. I want it to work for people who think they can't afford to design and low-socioeconomic-status communities who feel like their kids are being left out of the innovation economy.”

And when exactly do Ali and Nadeem sleep while trying to democratize design and fabrication? “On Sundays,” Ali says.
