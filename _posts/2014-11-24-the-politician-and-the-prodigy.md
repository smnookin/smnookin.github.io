Buddies Nadeem Mazen and Ali Mohammad were hungry. Like, really hungry. The two MIT graduate students were fasting for Ramadan and passing the afternoon in Ali’s office talking about food—specifically, dancing toasts. 

“It’s just all you think about at a certain part of the day,” says Ali. “You get to this Zen-like meditation state of mind.” They mused about the famous Virgin Mary grilled cheese that sold for $28,000 on eBay and the transcendent toaster kit that conjures the image of Jesus with every slice. They thought, what if we did that with thousands of images? It’d be like a flipbook, but instead of paper they’d use crispy bread, one image per slice.     

That conversation was on a Thursday back in 2009. The following Tuesday, Nadeem came back to Ali’s office in the Suess-like Stata Center and said, “Hey man, do you have time for a conference call?” 

“Sure. Who are we talking to?” Ali asked.

“OK Go,” Nadeem said, referring to the popular indie band. 

Just like that they were talking on the phone with Damien Kalush, lead singer of the Grammy-award-winning band. Someone had forwarded Nadeem and other creative friends an email from Kalush asking if anyone wanted to move to San Francisco to make a music video. Nadeem passed on San Francisco, but responded that he had an idea for a video they could create right here in Cambridge. “That’s the kind of guy he is—pretty aggressive,” Ali says.

“We just thought it would be really funny if we did a whole bunch of toasts and did stop motion—made a video with it. We didn’t really have an idea of how it would look or even how you would do it. It was just an idea,” Ali says. “I really have to give Nadeem credit, because he took it and he ran with it.”

It turned out that Kalush wanted to run with it too, but didn’t quite understand what “it” was. He kept saying he needed a visual reference—really see it. After contemplating and nixing a few ideas that would cost a fortune, Ali and Nadeem took to the highly equipped labs in the depths of MIT to play with laser cutters. Both guys say they just sort of taught themselves how to use the machines, which cut images programmed through computer software into wood, plastic, and other materials. Or they absorbed the skill through the kind of osmosis I imagine happens among the fiercely bright minds at MIT. 

They experimented with the lasers and loaves of soft, white bread until they perfected the routine. Because Nadeem and Ali were grad students at MIT, they had access to the industrial machines, but that didn’t mean they had permission to use them for their own extracurriculars. “I don’t know what the professors would have done if they saw us walking into the laser cutting room with loaves of bread,” Ali says. To avoid scolding, the two buddies would use the lab in the middle of the night when no one was there. “The MIT policy is asking for forgiveness,” Ali says.

Their stealth paid off. Kalush loved the prototypes. But it took the band about a year to obtain a sponsorship to cover the cost of three laser cutters—at around $30,000 a pop. (Samsung agreed to fund the video if it was shot with their new camera.) There’s no charmingly creative story behind the song that the group chose. They picked “Last Leaf” because it was shortest on the album. “Even at 12 frames a second, it’s pretty costly. It’s a lot of bread,” Ali says.

After nearly a year of collaborative design with OK Go and animators, Nadeem and Ali were left with only a week to actually make the video—a task they’d initially allotted a few months. Even if they visited every supermarket in Cambridge and Boston, they still wouldn’t have been able to secure the hundreds of loaves of bread they needed. And they didn’t want to hoard all the edible bread in the area. By luck, the Pepperidge Farm surplus store, which sells near-expiration products in bulk, is at the border of Cambridge and Belmont. Ali, Nadeem and their interns got pretty sick of seeing bread that week, so their diet was pretty low-carb except for the cheap Milano cookies from the surplus store, dunked in milk.

They worked at least eighteen hours per day, formatting the animation in the laser-cutting software then etching each slice of bread with a $50,000 machine, popping it into a cheap toaster, and carefully placing it in a Ziplock bag with the frame number. Had Ali not programmed a solution on the fly that automatically converted the animation files, which were in the wrong format, they wouldn’t have been able to finish. 
Eight sleepless days, 2,430 slices of bread, and a bunch of Milanos later, the music video was posted on YouTube and quickly went viral. Now, Nadeem and Ali have a shop in Cambridge dedicated to laser cutting pretty much everything, from glass tumblers to wedding invitations to leather jewelry. Danger!awesome, which also includes 3-D printers and community workshops, isn’t quite what Nadeem and Ali envisioned they’d be doing with their advanced degrees in biological engineering and computational linguistics.

Nadeem and Ali met through MIT’s Muslim Student Association (MSA) back in 2002. Nadeem had just started undergrad and Ali was starting his doctoral program. You might think it’s a bit odd for a twenty-something doc student to be hanging around with a freshman, but here’s the thing: they were both eighteen. Though you won’t hear it from him, Ali’s sort of a prodigy. His wife Nadia explains that he graduated high school at the age of 14 and then quadruple majored in physics, math, computer science and computer engineering at Kansas State. 

“I just started early,” he mumbles as she brags. 

Though Ali was always a fixture at MSA events, it wasn’t until a few years later that the two friends started talking about entrepreneurial things, Nadeem says. 
 
The business partners look like brothers with their thick eyebrows and beards, dark eyes, and black curly hair, which Nadeem wears in in a slick bun and Ali sports in an untamed ‘fro—small black-framed glasses buried in the depths.

Ali was born in Baltimore but grew up in Colorado before heading off to college in Kansas. He was always making random things with hammers and saws—nothing like the high-resolution machines he uses now. And he’d often get in trouble for taking things apart. “I remember I took apart a laptop, and every square inch of this pretty big room was parts—just little pieces everywhere,” Ali says, sitting in front of three life-size LiteBrites, a fly circling his mass of curls.

Looking around danger!awesome’s new underground space, it doesn’t appear that he’s grown out of the habit. Hunks of plywood, old doors, broken pots, and electronics cover the massive basement. It feels like a mad scientist’s lab, but one stocked with wood and wires instead of potions and petri dishes. 

I visit the new space two nights before the grand opening, and instead of cleaning up, Ali and his friend, Ethan Miller, are hard at work building a steamer for cappuccinos and lattes. "This is bullshit,” Ali says pointing to a deconstructed espresso machine on the table. “This shouldn't be $1,800. It has a good boiler but it only has one, and its job is to both produce steam and water for the espresso machine. And I don't think it does a good job."

“Nah,” says Ethan, who’s studied coffee for seven years.  

They inserted a better steam wand from a different espresso machine into a wooden case that they made using with a laser cutter. Next, they have to put in the wiring, connect the boiler to the steam wand, and bring in water from the outside. This steamer would just be for the milk. But the plan is to build an espresso machine too. “I know we can do a better job,” Ali says. 

“Ali’s skills blow my mind,” says Dariush Nejad, danger!awesome’s Director of Operations. "He's always working on something cool from making a soda rig to making a mini-arcade to perfecting a cappuccino. To say Ali likes coffee is an understatement.”

The irony is that Ali is actually pretty sensitive to caffeine. “If I have more than three cups of coffee a day, I’m just vibrating,” he says. 

Ali was finishing up his doctoral thesis on computational linguistics and teaching at MIT when he and Nadeem made the toast video in 2010. Google hired him soon after, even though he’d yet to defend his thesis and graduate. He left Google six months ago to focus on danger!awesome, but still works on some contractual projects. 

Moving forward, Nadeem hopes they can leverage Ali’s technical expertise even more to give danger!awesome a competitive edge. “He could be a seven-figure programmer if he wanted to be—so just giving him the space to step back form the day-to-day to design systems, programs and drivers.” Ali’s wife Nadia says he’s been offered corporate gigs, but hasn’t taken the bait. “He wants to test things out and spread his wings,” she says. 

Nadia first encountered Ali in September 2011 when she interviewed him and Nadeem by phone for a freelance piece she was writing on the shop. Nadia, who’s completed law school and is currently studying peace and conflict at UMass Lowell, also works as an editor for the website altmuslimah. Because of their similar Muslim backgrounds and outlooks on life, she and Ali stayed in touch through Facebook. Growing up in mostly Christian communities, it was uncommon for either of them to find that type of connection. 

Nadia has dark, straight hair and a makeup-free, olive complexion that would make any woman envious. A tiny silver stud adorns her nose. Generally soft-spoken, she explains that she’s always been anxious about meeting people and had reached a point in life where she was a bit cynical about relationships. “Then you meet somebody who's really all the things you were looking for but didn't know, and you just kind of feel at peace,” she says.

Nadia and Ali finally met in person in October 2012 and got married seven months later. “Muslims who are practicing look at someone they're dating as a prospective spouse,” Nadia explains. (With near-perfect timing, Ali interjects to ask if we’d like anything from Chipotle.) Not surprisingly, Ali designed and made their intricate wedding invitations with one of the shop’s laser cutters. 

The couple was recently hanging out in the new underground workshop late at night, and Nadia called out to Ali in a hopeful voice. “I thought, okay, she’s going to tell me it’s time to go home,” Ali says. Instead, she asked, “Can I test this material?” (She wanted to see if the laser could cut neoprene for fashion projects.) 

“I was so excited,” Ali says, beaming at her. 

Ali can be more reserved when around Nadeem, but he’s an extrovert nonetheless, Dariush says. “He’s like a big, smart teddy bear,” says Nick Paige, a danger!awesome designer.

“Nadeem is more the politician,” Nadia explains. “He’s good about getting people fired about things, and Ali is good about continuing that momentum.” The dynamic makes sense, given that Nadeem is a politician. He was elected to Cambridge City Council last November. He also co-founded and runs Nimblebot, an animation software startup that helps non-profits, the education sector, and new journalism make video advocacy more exciting and affordable. 

“From here to Nimblebot across the street, up to city hall, it's like Nadeem-land,” Dariush says. “He's always flying around here.” Described as frenetic and high-energy by his employees, Nadeem is certainly hard to pin down on earth. I only talked with him in person for a couple minutes at the new shop opening. The rest of our conversations were sporadic results of phone tag. 

Nadeem grew up in Andover, Massachusetts, and never really planned on being a politician or entrepreneur. Instead, he thought he’d become a robotosist. He was a public school kid who applied to the boarding high school Phillips Academy on a whim and got a substantial scholarship to attend. 

He had a unique experience early on with a teacher who pushed him to take harder and harder classes. “I felt like I was a very run-of the mill, local public school student who just worked hard but didn't know anything special,” Nadeem says. “But it really helped set me up for MIT.” 

Similar to Ali, Nadeem had taken so many advanced math and science courses that he could waive a year of credits at MIT, where he majored in biological and mechanical engineering. Instead of spending his senior year taking electives, he travelled to Cairo for his international affairs concentration, wrote a thesis, and created a video project. 

“I was a little bit under-guided and aimless in my undergrad career,” Nadeem says. “It ended up for the better, because I was able to ignore classes and just focus on community, society, policy, and development questions that were, to me, much more interesting.” He’s always felt there was a disconnect between his family’s emphasis on academic performance and a deep-seeded understanding that classwork doesn’t impact real exploration—though he imagines that’s changing with more hands-on learning in the classroom.

Nadeem’s father paints and his mother sketches, but he never had the same free-hand skill. Instead, he got into Flash animation and coding in his teens. After graduation, he and three buddies decided join the Mongolia Charity Rally, a drive from England to China to raise money for Go Help, which aims to improve education and healthcare access in Central Asia and Central America. Nadeem earned the $15,000 they needed for the trip through an animation job that only took him two days. “I haven't always been creative, but I've always been doing a lot of different things and some of those things became skills that I internalized,” he says. 

After a year off from the dreaded classrooms, Nadeem returned to MIT for a master’s in biological engineering. He put in hundreds of hours on the Media Lab’s laser cutters quietly making and selling art, in addition to working on animal pain research. He was actually able to create a mousetrap for medical research that’s a hundredth of the cost of current enclosures. “If I wanted to go make a fortune right now, I could go help people test on animals cheaply,” he says. “But I obviously would never want to do that.”

Nadeem actually started danger!awesome with Ali when he should’ve been writing his master’s thesis and continuing on to the doctoral program. But he firmly decided not to turn in his thesis or stay in biological engineering. “I was told by people around me, just submit anything and we'll approve it,” he says. “That was uncomfortable.”

He felt a similar discomfort when he started attending city meetings a few years ago for some of his service projects. At one particularly disheartening City Council meeting, the councilors were being extremely disrespectful and antagonistic to each other and ignoring two hours of public comments. “The legislators didn’t hear it, didn’t reflect on it, didn’t talk about it, didn’t refer back to it,” he says.

Nadeem gets why people think there’s something a little off about government. “But it’s really just a need for new, efficient problem solving, creativity, innovation, openness, transparency in government,” he says. 

Nadeem never did get into robotics. Instead, he realized that regardless of his job title, he’s going to make things and solve problems. He’s managed to solve the problem of under-advocated issues at Nimblebot, the problem of community engagement with high-tech learning at danger!awesome, and community problems as City Councilor. “I'm just kind of one guy trifurcated trying to do three things, and I see the next step as figuring out how to make those things roll on their own while I focus on, ideally, one of them,” he says. He’s hoping his mid-thirties will be much saner.

Despite being all over the map—of Cambridge, at least—Nadeem is still smart and thoughtful in how he approaches projects, Dariush says. And when it comes to danger!awesome projects, Nadeem’s got a solid partner in Ali. “They know their strengths and weaknesses, and they can counter-balance each other out,” Dariush says.

“One of us will work on the bottle neck and the other one will grab a bunch of stuff and jam it through,” Nadeem says. “I’m kind of trying to steer the ship and make it a bigger ship. There’s a lot of time when Ali is on the ground, running around filling gaps.”

Nadia doesn’t think either of them have many inhibitions. That’s probably why danger!awesome worked out the way it did. The scrappy pair pulled together the shop through their resources and know-how alone, Dariush says. 

After the OK Go music video, Nadeem and Ali stored their three laser cutters in a studio on Green Street, but were forced to move out when the landlord didn’t renew their lease in May 2011. “I had this image of a laser cutter in my living room,” Ali says. 

Nadeem called Ali about an open retail space around the corner from the Central Square T stop. Though every shop in the space had failed to stay open, it was kind of perfect for their three-by-two laser cutters that emit exhaust with every cut. Because the space is only one story, Ali and Nadeem could run a short exhaust pipe through the ceiling directly to the outside. 

Since the storefront gets decent foot traffic from students, yuppies, and families alike, they signed the lease and decided to turn their casual workshop into a full-blown business. Ali insisted on writing down a formal vision, which basically boils down to: “Get people to make stuff.”

“I think people were concerned that we didn’t know what we were doing,” Ali says.

“They’re still concerned,” Nadia says quietly, laughing.

The buddies-turned-business-partners opened danger!awesome in the spring of 2012 and slowly accumulated a small team. Ali and his younger sister came up with the name of the shop. “We just thought it would be really funny if the place was so great, so awesome, that it’s dangerous,” Ali says. 

In addition to the three laser cutters, the shop’s also stocked with two 3-D printers and a massive CNC router—a computer-controlled machine that can cut doors and other large slabs of wood with a laser. It took seven men and a crane to get it into the new underground space. 

“There's nowhere in the world that I know of that you can walk by a store front and see $30,000 lasers just in plain view for anyone to come in and get trained to use. All those things have been locked up in high-level research facilities or universities,” Dariush says. The danger!awesome team hopes to bring those tools to the public. That’s why, in addition to technicians who fulfill orders, the shop also has memberships for customers who want to use the machines themselves.

“The nice thing about laser cutters is that they’re really easy to use,” Ali says. One of the first things you learn in woodshop is that you can’t cut a straight line or right angles with a saw, so making a box is actually pretty complicated, he explains. “The laser cutter, you just say cut a box, and it cuts a box.”

A few customers have been a bit more creative with the laser cutters. One man asked the technicians to cut an enormous biohazard sign into his toilet seat. A woman cuts latex into dresses for Katy Perry and Pink, while a man cuts it into gurneys used in organ transplants. The only materials the lasers can’t cut through are metal and stone; they can only etch the surfaces. 

People often ask for laser-cut tattoos, but that’s one service danger!awesome doesn’t  provide—though they technically could. Lasers create a scar tissue tattoo, like a burn or brand. As I watch a designer give a demo on the laser cutter, I can see why. After he programs the image into the design software, the barely visible torch of the laser quickly cuts it into the neon pink acrylic. At one point the torch catches fire and singes the plastic. It’s an easy fix: just pause the machine and the machine’s fans take care of the rest. But I’m not quite sure what they’d do if there were a forearm in there instead.

Danger!awesome also hosts community workshops where people can learn to make specific products and walk out of the door with a tangible product in their hands, like leather masks or wooden rings. Since Ali always thought he might end up being a professor, the workshops are his favorite part of the job.

Ali and Nadeem plan to foster even more community engagement with their new, much larger space around the corner, which was funded by 727 backers on Kickstarter. In fact, the duo has so many friends and supporters that they had to host two opening nights in late November. On the first night, Nadeem zips around the room in a black blazer, dark jeans, and a skinny tie, taking photos and chatting with nearly every guest. Meanwhile, Ali, wearing a T-shirt, focuses on setting up the coffee. 

Moving forward, Nadeem says danger!awesome could go in a couple different directions. TechShop, a chain of similar member-based workshops using industrial machines, requires millions of dollars of investment for each new location and focuses on elite makers, Nadeem says. Danger!awesome is much smaller, and they want it to stay that way. But they also want it to be everywhere.

“We want to do for 3-D printing, design, and hands-on learning what Kinko’s did for simple access to printers,” Nadeem says. “What you really need is a place that brings it to the everyman, the everywoman. I want this to work for consumers. I want it to work for people who think they can't afford to design and low-socioeconomic-status communities who feel like their kids are being left out of the innovation economy.”

Ali agrees. “I think there’s something deeply fulfilling about making something. I have this idea that toolbuilding is something that we do instinctively. It’s like music, language and dance,” Ali says. “People have a lot of experience with music and language, but people don’t often do anything to make something. They don’t build things. Your creativity is limited to following instructions for Ikea. That’s why we’re here. To give people that fulfillment.”

And when exactly do Ali and Nadeem sleep while trying to revolution design and fabrication? “On Sundays,” Ali says.
