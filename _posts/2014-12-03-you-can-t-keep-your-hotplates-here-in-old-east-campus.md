I have a fear of open heights, but that didn't matter now: there was a fortcoaster in my dormitory's courtyard, and I was going to enjoy it, gut-wrenching phobia be damned. The steps to the second floor had sanded banisters and followed standard building codes—seven inches of rise for eleven inches of run—despite having been mostly constructed by freshmen, many of whom hadn't used power tools before current dorm residents had shown them how in the preceding week. Once up the stairs and on the landing, I texted my email address to a phone-based coaster queue a resident built which would alert you when your turn to ride. The system helpfully reports back to let me know that I am #13 in line: with roughly a dozen other people eyeing the coaster in front of me, this sounds about right. I take a seat on the couch (which had been suspended twenty feet off the ground from a neighboring tree only yesterday) and take in my surroundings.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology does on-campus housing a little differently than most colleges. Before arriving for their first semester on campus, incoming students are sent promotional videos produced by residents of each dorm, and asked to rank their preferred living spaces after viewing. Within the videos, denizens of the dorms can pitch the activities and personality of their living spaces: some are quiet and solitary, some are loud and driven by group projects, and some are anywhere and everywhere in between. Of course, most students manage to graduate, meaning that the batch of students who call the dorms home experiences nearly full turnover every four years. Institutional memory quickly becomes an issue, as within a decade not many alumni are local to tell you about their experiences living in the dorm. As a result, you might expect that over time, these promotions would drift in theme and tone, to match the changing dorm population and therefore culture—but you'd be wrong. It turns out that students' self-selection of their living spaces has led to the preservation and proliferation of those spaces' traditions and cultures…for _decades_.

To fully understand, look to the eastern half of MIT, where, nestled near a variety of academic labs and offices, sit two long, rectangular buildings. Both buildings are wrapped in MIT-standard yellow brick, and both are aligned north-south like compass needles. Each five stories tall, they form the West and East Parallels of the East Campus Alumni Houses undergraduate dormitory. East Campus is the second-oldest dorm on campus—turning ninety years old this fall. Within its walls coexist ten halls, each connected to its vertically adjacent neighbors physically but distinct in its personality. Tour the halls, and step between microcosms on every stairwell landing. An animated, illuminated electronic dance floor greets you on First East; elsewhere, a Second West resident dips a cup into a massive dewar of ultra-cold liquid nitrogen, collecting enough to make a personal serving of liquid-nitrogen-frozen ice cream; on Fifth East, two sophomores sleep soundly beneath a fluorescent dragon mural older than both of their ages combined; a group studying vector fields has taken up semi-permanent residence around a paper-littered table in Fourth West's black light lounge, where the walls are repainted annually with new glowing designs and messages. But step back out into the courtyard, and the halls' mascots and color schemes are overwhelmingly drowned out by the presence of forest-green shirts labelled with a unifying long-term brand: "EAsT camPUS."

East Campus is littered with tributes to its past, sometimes unintentionally. Last year, vinyl letters were added in the stairwells to indicate floors on each landing, as if the giant numbers painted nearby decades earlier didn't already indicate that information. It didn't take long for a walk up the Goodale staircase to involve passing such signs as "G  DALE FI ST EA T" and "G  DALE F UR TEAST", with the top floor's "GOOOOOOOOOOODALE FIFTH EAST" nicely wrapping up the mystery of the missing O's. Back in the mid-1930s, there was eerily similar chatter about eerily similar lettering:

> While this mild sabotage is of course "childish", "asinine", etc., Ye Goblin has always personally regarded such cute legends as "Good Ficci", and "Goo, 5ti OOP" as one of the most entertaining features of the old new dorms. More  power to our amateur sculptors. […] The pen (knife) is mightier than the brush.    

The quote comes from the Dorm Rumor, an undergraduate dormitory newspaper at the time, in its March 7, 1935 issue. Nearly eighty years later, not much has changed.

Through the 1930s, East Campus had its own social scene, government, and bowling league. One of East Campus' oldest living alumni, Richard Hanau ‘39, studied physics at MIT during his undergraduate tenure, and happened to reside for two years within the East Parallel. At the time, the parallels were politically divided in thirds, with each of the six houses acting as political entities. "Socializing was throughout the six dorms, not restricted to the one where a student lived," Hanau wrote in an email. His time in the dorm overlapped with a variety of early student-led, engineering-based pranks, which formed the roots of MIT's modern student hacking culture. In particular, [in 1936](http://tech.mit.edu/V56/PDF/V56-N17.pdf), students hoisted Ralph Slutz' automobile four stories into the air. "I saw the car after it had been pulled up the side of the dorm where I lived during my sophomore year," wrote Hanau. "It was later lowered and set on fire (I think) on the grass between the dorms." And sure enough, an April 7, 1936 article in The Tech article agrees: "The car was rolled in the court between the dorms and set on fire. Needless to say, the car is now a total wreck."

Of course the car was set on fire: pyrotechnics are no less fascinating to the denizens of East Campus today than at other points in the dorm's history. From [the 1928 water war](http://tech.mit.edu/V48/PDF/V48-N42.pdf) which involved igniting two abandoned, kerosene-soaked cars in the adjacent parking lot, to [the annual May Day riots](http://tech.mit.edu/V72/PDF/V72-N23.pdf) in the fifties which featured a bonfire of Institute furniture, to the 1964 Goodale 5 fire which burned out a newspaper-stuffed room, to [the 1998 Fourth West fire](http://tech.mit.edu/V118/N47/ecp113.47n.html) to which students responded by throwing a dance party to "We Didn't Start the Fire", to [East Campus' modern mascot](http://eastcamp.us/media/images/burning-man.gif) (as of 2003) which is literally a burning stickman: the dorm has never lost touch with its inner pyromaniac. This is not an inherently positive trait, but it is a persistent one nonetheless. 

The pre-war years in East Campus had traces of modern habits, but dorm loyalty wasn't really formed yet: in fact, "East Campus" was not even the common name for the residences. (Since 1931 they had been known as the Alumni Houses.) Nineteen-fifty, however, marked the beginning of the rise of what we would today consider dorm identity. The Tech's [November 17, 1950 issue](http://tech.mit.edu/V70/PDF/V70-N46.pdf) notes that "there has been much discussion by residents of the East Campus on whether or not they're going to have contract dinners at Walker \[Dining Hall\] in the future": this is the first usage of "East Campus" as a name for the dorm. The aforementioned May Day riots, complete with mayhem on the first weekend of May, are re-branded around 1959 as "East Campus Day," a springtime celebration of dormitory jubilance. In 1964, Baker-House resident Matt Fichtenbaum '66 and EC resident Dan Murphy '65 composed the song "Old East Campus," whose lyrics (well worth the [read](http://eastcamp.us/old-east-campus.shtml) and [listen](http://eastcamp.us/media/mp3/old-east-campus.mp3)) highlight circumventing hot plate restrictions, visitor hours, and safe volume levels. The exact gripes no longer apply, but the general attitude certainly does, and half a century after its release "Old East Campus" is still sung regularly at dorm events.    

Despite this progress to modern EC, the fifties and sixties did not see an East Campus quite like the dorm of today: while EC had begun to assert itself with a sense of identity, individual floors lacked their subcultures which differentiated them. In the words of John Niles '68: "There was no "hall identity" when I was living in EC, except a non-identity—do your own thing. It took several years during my time before I even learned the names of all the people on the 3rd East Hall." Three major changes led to the rise of halls' subcultures. First, in 1968, the halls were carpeted and two rooms per floor were converted into lounges: this was part of then-Dean of Student Affairs Ken Wadleigh's effort to effect "[the development of good quality of student living-learning environment in these houses](http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/presidents-reports/1968.pdf#page=543)," as he noted in the 1968 MIT President's Report. The result was nearly immediate. "Unprecedented community activities took place: games of bridge and Three Card Drop, tooling sessions (with blackboard), beer, slackers hanging out, etc." wrote Dave deBronkart '72, in a public email correspondence with other alumni from that era. Soon after the birth of halls' social spaces came changes in their social demographics: the MIT Corporation voted in March of 1970 to allow East Campus to go coed. By the fall of 1971, four of the ten halls had female undergraduate residents, and the difference in hall attitude was evident. "Coed floors were noticeably healthier.  Male-only floors were obsessed with sex and had a desperate, testosterone-laden attitude.  Coed floors were more normal with the types of interaction you would see in a normal home," wrote Bob Lamm '78 in a reply to deBronkart. Finally, halls were given a voice in the freshmen-room-assignment process within East Campus after 1970. From Doug White '74, also chiming in on the alumni thread: 
When we were allowed to have a "mini-rush" the next year so freshmen could select specific floors, we tried to make it clear to them that if they wanted a quiet place to study, 3rd East wasn't the best home for them. The more outgoing hacker-types got involved in the mini-rush, and we quickly decided that we should have someone high enough up on the local political food chain that we could have an insider on the floor assignment committee each Fall. From then on, the character of the Hall was self-reinforcing. I assume that process is largely still in place today.
"Self-reinforcing" is the takeaway there: any small jokes or personality biases of a hall could now be strengthened through artificial selection of where incoming students lived. Together, hall culture was primed to grow and proliferate in a way it could not have before.

The bulk of East Campus' traditions appear after these changes. The "Jack Florey Roof and Tunnel Hackers" shirt, designed in a parody of the Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey logo, finds its origins in the 1970s, and the shirts are still sold and worn by a large subset of the dorm's residents today. Third East picked up the nickname "Third East Travelling Animal Zoo" in the early 70s, and within a few years the abbreviation had become a moniker for the hall itself: Tetazoo. East Campus' oldest surviving murals date to this time period as well, with murals pretty much everywhere by the late 1980s. Fifth West's annual first-snowfall tradition, Flames over New Jersey, traces its roots to around 1980—the alumnus who began it, Ken Meltsner '83, still celebrates it with his family at their Wisconsin home. Even the kitchens were added in 1983, further increasing communal space and mutual support on each hall. 

In 2004, East Campus constructed [its first Rush roller coaster](http://vimeo.com/132498), nicknamed "8.01 The Ride"—after the freshman physics class, 8.01 Classical Mechanics. The following years brought new and increasingly ridiculous projects into the fray, until 2010, when the Cambridge Fire Department became aware of an unpermitted roller coaster (nicknamed "Reverse Cowgirl") which was operating in the courtyard of a dormitory at MIT. The following three years, Rush lacked its illustrious rides, and residents turned to constructing forts instead. This summer, however, the permits came through. Ten years of escalating Rush construction projects, and I find myself climbing the ladder to the third floor of the 2014 fortcoaster. I climb into the cart's seat, and watch the coaster's designers strap me in with a five-point harness. I make some comment about my nervousness, and one of them reassures me by letting me know that neither of the architects of the 140-foot roller coaster I am strapped to had ever actually been on a roller coaster themselves before this one. _Great._ Before I can respond, they start the countdown, and push me off into the great unknown. The descent is terrifying, but the cart swooshes magically along the track without screeching or jolting. At the far end of the track is a vertical section: for a brief moment I hang weightless at the zenith, taking in the scenery of East Campus at its best, then come rolling back forward and eventually to a stop. [The Soviet national anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs) begins to blare from speakers on the other side of the courtyard as I get out and head back to pass the helmet to the next person in line. Nothing is new about the use of communist imagery around East Campus: [the 2000 East Campus Rush shift design](http://eastcamp.us/media/images/photos/shirts/full/ec-rush-2000-front.jpg), and [a May 6, 1952 issue of _The Tech_](http://tech.mit.edu/V72/PDF/V72-N23.pdf) describes "a mock communist appearance…led by a student in a red cape, [who] played the communist "Internationale" to the delight of the Boston newspaper reporters." Nothing that happens here is actually _new_; it's all been done before, but that historical underpinning is what makes this place so attractive. As the anthem hits its crescendo, the thought sinks in: I rode and survived a goddamn fortcoaster. Not a bad way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
