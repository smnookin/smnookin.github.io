![](http://images.nymag.com/news/media/1972-0214-cover-250.jpg)One of the towering talents that gave birth to a new, more visceral and personal brand of journalism looks back at its founding a decade later. "God knows I didn't have anything new in mind, much less anything literary, when I took my first newspaper job," Wolfe writes, describing his arrival at the now-defunct _New York Herald Tribune_ in 1962. It wasn't long before he, along with other restless Herald-Tribune talents like [Charles Portis](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/books/20portis.html?pagewanted=all) and [Jimmy Breslin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Breslin), realized that they could create a new type of writing: Non-fiction that "read like a novel."
