Gonzo journalist **Hunter S Thompson** tracked the Democratic Party throughout the George McGovern's freewheeling election campaign in 1972. The articles were collected in a book that the _New York Times_ described as "a mixture of personal narrative, diary entries, tape-recorded interviews and telephone conversations with the candidates and their managers, occasionally irrelevant fantasies and--towards the end when he was running past his deadline--an extended interview with himself."
