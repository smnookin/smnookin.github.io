title: Ken Fan’s Angle on Girls Math Education
---

In a world where the number of women in STEM far lags behind the number of men, Dr. Ken Fan has dedicated his life to narrowing this gender gap. He spends his time mentoring middle school girls one-on-one in his own non-profit, Girls’ Angle. Unmarried and with no children, he has centered his life around this small building in Central Square—the location kept secret from anyone outside of the organization. 

Several years ago, Fan would have never expected to work in a nonprofit. Instead, he was envisaging the world of academia. He had already pocketed degrees from top universities—a PhD in Mathematics at MIT and an A.B. in Harvard University— and was teaching as an assistant mathematics professor at Harvard. He was rising up the ranks, aiming for the position that every academic dreams of: tenure in a top-level university.

Despite his prestigious position, Fan was felt a calling to become an oil-painter. Painting was a passion he’d realized only briefly after finishing his MIT thesis, and Fan understood that joining the academic world would shut the door to that opportunity. So he left in order to try his luck as a full-time oil painter, and eventually, he returned to the mathematics world with the goal of improving girls’ education. 
									…
We were in Andala Coffeehouse—since Girls’ Angle was off-limits—a quirky little Middle Eastern coffee shop in Central Square. I had arrived early and was so absorbed in admiring the colorful and carefully placed Moroccan chairs and cabinetry, that by the time I returned, he was already waiting. I found him seated a few tables away, impatiently thumbing through his cell phone with his back slightly curved. He wore a crisp button-down shirt with blue jeans and had the poor posture of someone who worked in front of a computer all day. 

“Oh! Were you sitting there the whole time?” he asked when I walked up to him, his dark almond-shaped eyes wide with concern. His eyes were slightly wrinkled at the corners, but it was nearly impossible to guess at is age. It certainly didn’t help that he had “forgotten” his age.

He could have been anywhere between his late-thirties and mid-forties. His heart-shaped face was framed with short, black hair carefully parted just above his right eyebrow, and he wore thin-rimmed rectangular glasses.

His genuine concern for my state of mind resonated with the words of one of his co-workers, Jane Wang: “I don’t understand how a person can be so nice.”
And considering his elite background, it is only a wonder how Fan can remain so humble.
										…
Fan strives to improve K-12 U.S. math education. He founded Girls’ Angle in 2007 with nothing but his own pocket money with the vision of top-university academics personally encouraging K-12 girls to pursue math and acting as their role models.

In a podcast, Fan said that the biggest reason for the national math education decline is the “disconnect between the mathematical world and the math education world.” 
He questions why the buzzing math savored by undergraduate level students and the breathing theoretical math envisioned by academics are so different from the “cold” textbook math taught to children. “I want Girls’ Angle to be a force pushing math education in a good direction,” Fan said. 

 “Math is a creative field,” he says, “it is not a fossilized subject.” It irks him that children, especially young girls, are taught math in this fixed way. He believes that there is a chasm between the mathematics of academics and the mathematics of K-12 students, and that this gap is to blame for so many students leaving math behind whenever it got tough—especially young girls.
 
Fan realized just how wide this chasm was while working as a freelancer in math education publishing. “Every week I’d have something like a horror story,” he told me. “There were conceptual errors in the material and sometimes you can’t even fix it because… [the editors] will go with how the marketing team responds.” They didn’t really care about the children, he said.

He shook his head and smiled softly—as if the trying to hide just how shocking the memory was. He had an easy smile—the kind that looked like it was about to dimple. It was certainly the rejuvenating smile one would expect from an oil painter—but definitely not the smile of an MIT-alum-ex-Harvard professor. 

The waiter came around and he ordered a hummus salad. Whenever he wasn’t talking, he would eat very carefully, as if he were being extra cautious not to let any food fall off his fork. 

He continued: That experience “really lit a fire inside me and I thought that I should try to do something to improve math education.”

He focuses on girls’ education, in particular, because “the way math is taught favors boys,” Fan explained. “We’re still in society where the stereotype is perpetuated that girls aren’t good at math.” He envisions a system that teaches girls how to create and solve their own math problems in an individualized manner, rather than the classroom textbook approach. 

He pointed out that every so often he’d see girls wearing t-shirts with messages like “allergic to algebra” or “I’m too pretty to do my math homework so I get my brother to do it for me.” He explained that these perpetuated stereotypes are a huge reason why there are so few women that pursue math as a career. 

The extracurricular math programs that attempt to fix this issue, Fans says, also favor boys because they are based on competition. He explained that boys are much more motivated by competition than girls, so such extracurricular math clubs do very little to encourage girls. 

“One of the things Girls’ Angle tries to do is create new venues and activities that are non-competitive,” he said. “We call them math collaborations” because “math is not a competition.”

**Ken Fan before Girls’ Angle**

Fan, from Maryland, describes himself as an “Air Force brat.” His father was a pediatrician in the Air Force, a job that would move the family several times within Hawaii, California and Maryland. Through all of this change, education was an important constant for him and his sister. It was no surprise then, that Fan’s father was deeply involved in their education.

Fan recalls one particular day when he was just six years old. He was building a bridge out of cardboard out in the backyard, and his father, noticing, came over to help. 
“It kept toppling over,” Fan said, and his father told him, “ ‘Alright, I’m going to do something to you and I want you to pay attention to your reaction.’ ”

Six-year-old Fan, excited and naïve, agreed so his father reached out and pushed him. Startled Fan barely stopped himself from toppling over. “ ‘What did you just do?’ ” his father asked.

Taken by surprise—and a little shocked—, little Fan couldn’t figure it out, so his father pushed him again. 

This went on a few more times. “Finally, I understood that my foot went back to keep me from falling over,” Fan said. He realized that instead of using vertical supports for the cardboard bridge, the supports should be triangular. “Just like your legs would form when you get pushed,” Fan said. 

“[My father] was very patient,” Fan told me. “He really let me figure it out. He really waited and waited.” And that is one of the tenets Fan aims to follow in his teaching approach. “We can’t do this with all [of our] students,” he said, but “we are like cheerleaders.” He wants Girls’ Angle to be a program that focuses more on teaching girls problem solving skills, rather than actual content.
										…
When the family moved to Maryland, Fan was in high school and his father wanted him to learn more advanced physics—physics outside of the regular high school curriculum. So his father took him to the University of Maryland College Park campus to find out if he could enroll in a physics class.  There, they met a professor who immediately asked Fan if he knew calculus and Fan, having had taught himself calculus the past summer, said yes.

The professor then asked him if he knew the derivative of tangent. 

“I said ‘No’ but that I could derive it,” Fan said. So the professor erased half of the lecture board and asked him to write out the derivation. After Fan was finished, the professor recommended that he take a math class instead of a physics class. 

Soon Fan was enrolled in Honors Calculus Analysis. “It was my first introduction to rigorous mathematics,” Ken said. “[It] really turned me onto math.”

This experience is what propelled him into the world of mathematics and a huge reason why he ended up at MIT studying doctorate-level math. He focus in math continued until he finished his thesis and it then that he discovered a new passion: drawing and painting.

Fan recalls his first drawing class—a class he had randomly picked out for the January Independent Activities Period at MIT. It was a charcoal drawing class and the instructor asked the students “to pick out an object in the room and draw it,” Fan said. 
“The first instance the charcoal hit the paper, I kind of fell in love.” He describes his new-found passion as a sort of “conversion.” 

“I would draw all the time,” he told me.  

The instructor, noticing Fan’s fixation, recommended that he try out oil-painting as well. So Fan did. He took a course at the Museum of Fine Arts and loved oil-painting so much that he continued to paint after graduating from MIT. 

“Oil painting is the most magical medium ever,” he said. “It’s designed for human flesh.”

It is this same passion and excitement that Fan instills in his work at Girls Angle. Even though he is no longer able to paint recreationally, he still continues to draw and he hopes that as Girls Angle grows he will be able to continue drawing.

According to Wang, Fan can occasionally be found teaching the girls different painting and different techniques. It is no surprise considering that math and art worlds are so intertwined. Theories such as the golden ratio show that mathematicians tend to appreciate art at a different level than the average art enthusiast. 

More importantly, Fan hopes that Girls’ Angle will be able to instill a change in the math educational system so that students can receive more individualized attention. 
Fan acknowledges that this goal will be difficult to achieve. “It’s just like in mathematics,” he told me. “The circle is an ideal concept and you can never actually draw a perfect circle…It’s always a work in progress.”
										…
Fan’s math collaborations aim to approach this ideal. The Girls’ Angle mentors pit all the participants against some fictitious entity—evil ghosts, treasure hunts, locked treasure chests, etc—and the girls have to work together to solve the puzzle. The club’s activities culminate in a Summit where the girls are faced with their biggest challenge of the season. 

One of Fan’s favorite events was a 2012 SUMIT called "The Spirit of Hypatia." Ken laughed as he recalled the story. The girls were taken to a large room with rows of desks with a pencil and paper each. On the paper said “DO NOT TURN UNTIL INSTRUCTED TO DO SO” and, when the session began, each girl was shocked to find only one short math problem. When they finished, they realized that none of the mentors were ending the session, so they kept looking at each other awkwardly, wondering what to do next. 
Fan smiled, “It had all the rules of a standardized test except ‘do not talk’.” The girls couldn’t figure out why the mentors were not ending the exam.

Finally, one of the girls suggested combining all the answers and they discovered a secret message: “Find the spirit of Hypatia.” 

From there the girls went on to solve different puzzles and ultimately found some hidden treasure. Ken smiled his almost-dimple smile again. “[The SUMITs are] a fun and exciting challenge!”  he said, but it only works because the “mentors work closely with each other,” sharing and developing ideas to ensure that the girls receive high quality education. He hopes that Girls’ Angle can grow such that “parents can entrust [them] with the entire math education of their daughter.”

“Running a non-profit is a tremendous challenge,” Fan admits, but it is very satisfying. He thinks of Girls’ Angle as a “conveyor belt” with mentors constantly pulling the girls to the next level.
