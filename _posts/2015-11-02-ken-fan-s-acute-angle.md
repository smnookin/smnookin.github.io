title: Ken Fan’s Acute Angle
---

Ken Fan is a man of many degrees. He has been awarded advanced degrees in mathematics in MIT and Harvard University as well as working as an assistant mathematics professor in Harvard. Unlike the common track that students in elite schools tend to follow—continuing in academia or working for a huge firm or company—Fan rotated a complete 360 and went back to focus on the demographic often forgotten about by elite higher-ups: K-12 level girls.

**Ken Fan Now: Girls’ Angle**

Fan founded Girls’ Angle in 2007 in Cambridge, MA with nothing but the money he had saved up from his days in Harvard and his days working as a freelancer in math education publishing—most of which had been used up chasing a newly-discovered dream to become an oil-painter.  This decision was largely driven by his frustration working in math education publishing. “Every week I’d have something like a horror story,” he told me during my interview. “There we conceptual errors in the material and sometimes you can’t even fix it because… [the editors] will go with how the marketing team responds.” 

He shook his head and laughed at the ridiculousness of it all. He had the sort of smile that made me expect his face to dimple—the sort of smile that automatically feel you feel at ease, and certainly the kind of smile you’d expect from anyone EXCEPT an MIT-alum-ex-Harvard professor. It made him look ten years younger. “That really lit a fire inside me and I thought that I should try to do something to improve math education.” 

Girls’ Angle is based on the idea that “the way math is taught favors boys.” Ken explained that “we’re still in society where the stereotype is perpetuated that girls aren’t good at math.” And in a world where girls’ t-shirts say “allergic to algebra” and “I’m too pretty to do my math homework so I get my brother to do it for me,” it is really no surprise that there are so few women that pursue math as a career.

There are some math programs that attempt to fix this issue, but most are math competition-based which, according to Ken, is a problem because “math is not a competition.” He also explained that boys are much more motivated by competition than girls, so such extracurricular math clubs do little to encourage girls. “One of the things Girls’ Angle tries to do is create new venues and activities that are non-competitive,” he said. “We call them math collaborations.” 

How does it work? The various mentors at Girls’ Angle pit all the participants against some fictitious entity—evil ghosts, finding treasure and so on—and the girls have to work together into solve the puzzle. The club’s activities culminate in a Summit where the girls are faced with their biggest challenge yet. 

One of Fan’s favorite Summits is one where the girls were taken to a large room with rows of desks with a pencil and paper each. On the paper said “DO NOT TURN UNTIL INSTRUCTED TO DO SO” and, when the session began, each girl was shocked to find only one short math problem. When they finished, they realized that none of the mentors were ending the session, so they kept looking at each other awkwardly, wondering what to do next. 

Fan laughed, “It had all the rules of a standardized test except ‘do not talk’.” Finally, one of the girls suggested combining all the answers and they discovered a secret message: “Find the spirit of Hyteshia.” 
From there the girls went on to solve different puzzles and ultimately found some hidden treasure. Ken smiled his almost-dimple smile again. “It’s a fun and exciting challenge!”  he said.

This approach only works, he told me, because “mentors work closely with each other, sharing and developing ideas to ensure that the girls receive high quality education. He hopes that Girls’ Angle can grow such that “parents can entrust [them] with the entire math education of their daughter.”

**Ken Fan before Girls’ Angle**
Fan describes himself as an “airforce brat.” His father was heavily involved with the military and so the whole family was forced to move around a lot. From Hawaii to California, back to Hawaii and then to Maryland, Fan never really got to make and keep close childhood friends. And with that, he only grew closer to his parents.
