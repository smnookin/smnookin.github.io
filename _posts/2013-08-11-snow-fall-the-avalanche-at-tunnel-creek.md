In December 2012, the New York Times released a massive multimedia package on an avalanche in Washington state, combining text, video, audio, and graphic components. Though 'Snow Fall' won the team a Pulitzer Prize for featurewriting, it ignited fierce discussion about what it means to do journalism in the digital age. Some celebrated the piece as "the first truly post-tablet storytelling experiences," while others dismissed it as a "Snowfail."
