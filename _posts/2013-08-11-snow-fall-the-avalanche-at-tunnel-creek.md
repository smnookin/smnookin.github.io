In December 2012, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek" target="_blank">_The New York Times_ released a massive multimedia package on an avalanche in Washington state, combining text, video, audio, and graphic components</a>. Though the package won the _Times_'s John Branch a Pulitzer Prize for featurewriting, it ignited fierce discussion about what it means to do journalism in the digital age. Some celebrated the piece as "the first truly post-tablet storytelling experiences," while others dismissed it as a "Snowfail."
