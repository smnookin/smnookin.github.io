title: Peer Ears and the Limits of Confidentiality
---

When Caroline Mak was a high school senior in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, she looked up to former classmate Phoebe Wang, who was a freshman at MIT at the time. When Mak arrived at MIT last August, one year after Wang, Mak looked to the sophomore as a confidant and advisor. One month later, Mak was as shocked as the rest of the MIT community [to learn that Wang was dead](http://tech.mit.edu/V135/N7/Wang.html), one more in a line of suicides that brought the Institute into the national spotlight. 

It was, Mak said, “a wakeup call into MIT culture I didn’t see before.”

The semester after Wang’s death, Mak joined the just-launched [Peer Ears](http://mitpeerears.org/), a group of undergraduates trained by MIT to help students in their dorms cope with mental health issues. The goal of Peer Ears is to encourage students to reach out when they first need help instead of waiting for the situation to become a crisis. Targeting students who may be more comfortable speaking with a peer than an authority figure, Peer Ears members are confidential and non-mandated reporters, meaning that unlike MIT Medical staff, they're not legally required to report abuse cases to the appropriate state agencies. Neither Peer Ears nor MIT Medical staff are required to report Title IX violations to MIT administration. 

“In MIT culture right now, people just don’t talk to each other,” Mak says. “I wanted to improve the community through outreach. It’s really important to me that people have the right impressions of what resources are out there that are made clear.”

The Peer Ears program started last semester. Currently, there are 39 members covering nine undergrad dorms and four sororities. Peer Ears members receive training on topics ranging from suicide prevention to how to guide students to the right MIT resources. Taylor Sutton, a junior Peer Ear at Random Hall, says he's talked to students about a long list of issues. “A lot of it has been stress about classes, family issues, impostor syndrome, stress about the future," he says. Relationship concerns, general anxiety and depression come up frequently too. Everything discussed with a Peer Ear is "completely confidential" says Mak. “We are not required to report anything to Mental Health." 

How confidentiality and non-mandatory reporting play out in practice is not always clear. Peer Ears members often discuss cases amongst themselves, and sometimes seek advice from their mentors at MIT Mental Health on specific problems. While Peer Ears members are not expected to file reports with state agencies, they are expected to keep their mentors informed, which can sometimes require revealing identifying information about the person in need. Daniel Debowy, a Peer Ears mentor and psychiatrist at MIT Mental Health and Counseling, says that the best way to help sometimes requires bringing in a Mental Health staffer the student already has a relationship with, or a member of the student’s residential house team.

“One possibility is that the Peer Ear might tell us their name, and we might see whether there’s an internal medicine person that works with them," Debowy says. "Then, we could highlight to their primary care provider that information has come to us that there may be a family issue. Maybe that’s something they should raise with them the next time they have an office visit."

Another possibility, Debowy adds, is to ask an MIT mental health liaison, Residential Life Area Director (RLAD), or Graduate Resident Tutor (GRT) to stop by the student's room to check in. GRTs, graduate students who live in undergraduate dorms, are expected to keep House team members and administration informed about “serious or potentially serious/dangerous resident issues” according to the [Division of Student Life](http://studentlife.mit.edu/sites/default/files/GRT%20Position-Program%20Overview.pdf), as well as incidents “that require follow-up, or are medical or mental health in nature.”

Suicidal ideation is another scenario where confidentiality can be limited. Peer Ears receive suicide prevention training and are expected to call for help if a student is in immediate danger of causing harm to themselves or others. In cases where a student does not have a plan or a means to take their life, Debowy says that he expects Peer Ears to bring up the issue at internal meetings and reveal the identity of the student so Mental Health Services can take further action.

“Peer Ears are peer support counselors, they are not supposed to be professionals," Debowy says. 
 
One issue neither Mental Health nor Peer Ears are mandated to report, however, is Title IX violations, which covers sexual harassment and misconduct, intimate partner violence, and stalking. Mental Health and Peer Ears along with MIT’s Violence Prevention and Response Center, health practitioners at MIT Medical, the Ombudsman office, and religious advisors are all non-mandatory reporters who are not required to report violations to the MIT Title IX office. Members of dormitory house teams, such as housemasters, GRTs, and RLADs, are mandatory reporters.

Debowy says that as of yet, Peer Ears hasn't run into scenarios that require breaking confidentiality. "There are only a couple of circumstances where the Peer Ear might reveal a name in a situation," he says. "When we're talking about the overwhelming bulk of cases, the Peer Ears aren't telling us identifying information."

Mak says that she has never felt pressured by Mental Health to reveal the name of a student when seeking advice. “I did tell them about a friend who had suicidal ideation last year," she says. Whens he discussed the case with her mentor at MIT mental health, they decided it wasn't a situation that required Mak to reveal the person's name. "There were no immediate plans or means to follow through, and the person seemed to have a good support network," Mak says.

Evelyn Florentine, a Peer Ear in Burton-Conner who worked at a teen crisis hotline before coming to MIT, says that she would bring up issues of suicidal ideation depending on the severity.

“If someone says, 'Sometimes I feel like life isn't even worth living,' and you bring it up with them and they say, 'Sometimes, I have these thoughts, but I would never commit suicide,' that is actually suicidal ideation," Florentine says. "I wouldn't need to bring it up [with Mental Health] because it's very common that people have some of these thoughts, but would never act on it. If they were seriously thinking about hurting themselves, I would tell someone immediately.” 

Both Mak and Florentine said that they would be open with students about what information Peer Ears shared. “It's important to have a transparent policy on our website and be completely clear about everything," Florentine says. "No one is going to tell someone about their problems unless they know what will happen with that information.”
