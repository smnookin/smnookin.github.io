When Caroline Mak was a senior in high school in Pennsylvania, she’d seen classmate Phoebe Wang as an inspiration. When Mak arrived at MIT, one year after Wang, Mak looked to the sophomore as a confidant and advisor. “Phoebe gave me an anchor,” Mak wrote on her blog. “She demystified, humanized a place that had intimidated me since middle school.”

Then, last September, barely one month into Mak’s freshman year, Mak and the rest of the MIT community learned that Wang was dead, one more in a line of suicides that has brought the Institute into the national spotlight.

It was, Mak said, “a wakeup call into MIT culture I didn’t see before.”

The semester after Phoebe’s death, Mak joined Peer Ears, a group of 40-some undergraduate students who are trained and mentored by MIT Mental Health to help students in their dorms with mental health issues.

“In MIT culture right now, people just don’t talk to each other,” Mak said. “I wanted to improve the community through outreach. It’s really important to me that people have the right impressions of what resources are out there that are made clear.”

According to a 2015 MIT Healthy Minds Study, 49% of undergraduate respondents said that “preferr[ing] to deal with issues on their own” and “question[ing] how serious their needs are” were factors that caused them to receive fewer mental health services than they otherwise would have received.

The program targets students who may be more comfortable speaking with a peer, rather than an authority figure at MIT. Peer Ears are confidential and non-mandated reporters, which means that unlike staff at MIT Medical, they are not legally required to report cases of child, spousal, or elder abuse to the appropriate state agency. They are also not required to report cases of Title IX violations, such as sexual misconduct, to the MIT Title IX office, unlike members of dormitory house teams.

“We are not required to report anything to Mental Health. We are not required to submit reports, nothing. Your conversation with us is completely confidential,” Mak said.

But, as it turns out, how confidentiality and non-mandatory reporting play out in practice is not as clear cut as Mak makes it out to be, underscoring the general student population's lack of clarity around what happens to the information they share.

Evelyn Florentine, a Peer Ear in Burton-Conner, said, “It's still a bit convoluted. I think at this stage, students don't really know what Peer Ears is yet. They know they can talk to someone, but they might not know all the issues we're trained to handle.”

The program, which started last semester, is in a soft launch state and currently covers 10 undergrad dorms and 3 sororities. Peer Ears have received training on topics ranging from how to guide students to the right MIT resource to suicide prevention. Mak estimates that around 100 people across all residences have spoken to a Peer Ear so far.

Taylor Sutton, a Peer Ear at Random Hall, says he's talked to students about a long list of issues. “A lot of it has been stress about classes, family issues, impostor syndrome, stress about the future... relationship issues, and general anxiety and depression.”

One of the advertised differences between Peer Ears and employees of MIT Medical is that unlike employees, Peer Ears are not mandatory reporters. Massachusetts state laws designate certain professions as mandatory reporters, who are legally compelled to report cases or suspicion of abuse and neglect of children under the age of 18, elder abuse, or spousal abuse. In the case of child abuse, failure to report can result in a fine up to $1000, or in cases of willful failure to report leading to severe harm of the child, a fine up to $5000 and up to 2.5 years in prison.

Peer Ears often discuss cases within the group or with their mentors at Mental Health to seek advice. Though one Peer Ear originally said they would be able to ask for advice that may trigger mandatory reporting laws without revealing a student's name, Daniel Debowy, a psychiatrist at MIT Mental Health & Counseling and one of the Peer Ears’ mentors, says that is not the case.

While Peer Ears are not expected to file reports with a state agency, they are expected to keep their mentors at Mental Health informed. Debowy says he would need to know the student's identity to best help them, usually by bringing in someone from Mental Health that the student has a relationships with or a member of the student’s house team to follow-up.

“One possibility is that the Peer Ear might tell us their name, and we might see whether there’s an internal medicine person that works with them. Then, we could highlight to their primary care provider that information has come to us that there may be a family issue - maybe that’s something they should raise with them the next time they have an office visit.

“If they didn’t have a visit scheduled, we might have a MT Mental health liaison to their dorm or someone like a GRT or RLAD to encourage them to talk to [the student] about stress,” said Debowy.

MIT’s GRTs, graduate students who live in the undergraduate dorms, are expected to “keep members of the House team, and/or administrators informed about serious or potentially serious/dangerous resident issues,” according to the Division of Student Life’s GRT position description. In addition, they are required to inform the Housemaster and or Area Director of “key incidents in the residence hall that require follow-up, or are medical or mental health in nature.”

Suicidal ideation, defined as thinking about, considering, or planning suicide, is another scenario in which confidentiality can be limited.

Peer Ears receive suicide prevention training and are expected to call for help – for example, by bringing the student to Urgent Care, or calling a Dean on Call or 911 – if a student is in immediate danger of causing harm to themselves or others.

In cases of suicidal ideation where a student does not have a plan or a means to take their life, Debowy says that he expects peer Ears to bring up the issue at internal meetings and share the identity of the student that would allow Mental Health to take further action.

“We might decide in the end that we’re not going to have the Peer Ear to do anything further. But it will probably trigger us to pursue it somehow...Peer Ears are peer support counselors, they are not supposed to be professionals. The bulk of them do understand that, but unfortunately, we need to keep clarifying it,” said Debowy.
 
One case neither Mental Health nor Peer Ears are mandated to report, however, is the occurence of Title IX violations, which covers sexual harassment and misconduct, intimate partner violence, and stalking. Mental Health and Peer Ears join MIT’s Violence Prevention & Response center, health practitioners at MIT Medical, the Ombudsman office, and religious advisors as non-mandatory reporters, who are not required to report violations to the MIT Title IX office. In contrast, members of dormitory house teams, such as housemasters, GRTs, and RLADs are mandatory reporters.

Debowy says that as of yet, Peer Ears hasn't run into scenarios that required breaking confidentiality. 

"Sutudents know in general that it is confidential. There are only a couple of circumstances, where the Peer Ear might reveal a name in a situation. When we're talking about the overwhelming bulk of cases, the Reer Ears aren't telling us identifying information," he said.

Mak says she has never felt pressured by Mental Health to reveal a name of a student when seeking advice.

“I did tell them about a friend who had suicidal ideation last year. The person had already been seeing someone at Medical. When I discussed it with Dan, we both gauged it wasn't a situation that required revealing the person's name, as there were no immediate plans or means to follow through [with suicide], and the person seemed to have a good support network," she said. 

Maks also says she would work with the student to match them up to the best resource, breaking confidentialiy only as a last resort. 

"If I offered to bring in someone like a GRT, and the student said no, then I wouldn't bring them in. I'd ask them why and lay out other options – RLAD, Mental Health, off campus resources, etc. If they turn down every one of them, that's indicative of them not wanting help at all, and that's a red flag. In that case, I would tell someone and get follow-up help."

Florentine, who worked at a teen crisis hotline before coming to MIT, says that she would bring up issues of suicidal ideation depending on the severity.

“If someone says, 'Sometimes I feel like life isn't even worth living,' and you bring it up with them and they say, 'Sometimes, I have these thoughts, but I would never commit suicide,' that is actually suicidal ideation. I wouldn't need to bring it up [with Mental Health] because it's very common that people have some of these thoughts, but would never act on it.

“But if they were seriously thinking about hurting themselves, I would tell someone immediately,” said Florentine.

Both Mak and Florentine said that they would be open with students about what information Peer Ears shared.

“It's important to have a transparent policy on our website and be completely clear about everything...students have a right to know. No one is going to tell someone about their problems unless they know what will happen with that information,” said Florentine.
