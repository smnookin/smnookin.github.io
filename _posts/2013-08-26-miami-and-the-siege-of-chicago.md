![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/MiamiAndTheSiegeOfChicago.jpg)In 1968, _Harper's_ magazine sent Mailer, already one of the most famous writers in America, to cover <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/21W/fa13/21W.737/courseMaterial/topics/topic7/readings/Mailer_--_Miami_1968/Mailer_--_Miami_1968.pdf">the 1968 Democratic and Republican National Conventions</a> and <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/21W/fa13/21W.737/courseMaterial/topics/topic7/readings/Mailer_--_Chicago_1968/Mailer_--_Chicago_1968.pdf">the anti-Vietnam war protests</a> that surrounded them. When the pieces were collected in book form, _The Washington Post_ wrote, "For historians who wish for the presence of a world-class literary witness at crucial moments in history, Mailer in _Miami and Chicago_ was heaven-sent."
