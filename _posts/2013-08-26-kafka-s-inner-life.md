In _New Republic_, **William Giraldi** reviews _Kafka's Inner Life_ by **Saul Friedländer**, <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112836/saul-friedlanders-franz-kafka-reviewed-billy-giraldi">a portrait of Kafka before his name became an adjective.</a> "Kafka’s genius is easily snatched for misappropriation because it asserts itself in shadows," Giraldi writes. "A vision of existence as seemingly cryptic and complex as Kafka’s inevitably becomes a strip of flypaper to catch any interpretation that buzzes by it."
