title: The long struggle of women at the New York Times
---

In July 1972, a dozen women entered the New York Times boardroom, some for the first time, to meet with the paper’s all-male executive management. On the agenda? A damning five page letter signed by 50 women on staff, alleging systematic discrimination at the nation’s paper of record. 

Women were underrepresented at all levels of the paper. More damningly, there was hard evidence of a wage gap, in which men were paid more than their equally qualified (and sometimes more qualified) female counterparts. 

It was a watershed moment. Promises were made, a memo went out...and then nothing happened. Two years later, the same group of women would file a historic lawsuit against the paper, paving the way for future generations of women at the Times.

These events, and the lives of the women at its center, are chronicled by Nan Robertson in The Girls in the Balcony. Robertson, who was present at the 1972 meeting, takes a backseat in the story and lets the events unfold by themselves. She does a grand job taking readers through a history of women at the Times, starting from the “Dark Ages” from 1896 - 1935, where only four women worked as reporters in the Times city room (publisher Adolph Ochs thought women belonged at thome), through World War II, where women entered the workforce in droves (but not at the New York Times!) to present day 1992. 

Half the book is dedicated to a biography of all the exceptional women who worked at the Times. One stand out story is that of Anne McCormick, the Pulitzer prize winning correspondent who galloped through Europe and chronicled the rise of fascism through World War II. Portions of this section of the book read like a celebration, right until the spectre of sexism looms its ugly head. This is the head-banging experience of reading the book - for every triumph, there is an equal setback, a sexist male editor, a missed promotion. 

Where the book really picks up though, is in the second half, where Robertson dives deep into the events of the lawsuit. Seven women put their reputations on the line as plaintiffs, suing on behalf of all 550 women at the Times. Robertson details the professional and emotional fallout that ensues. The judge intimates the plaintiffs, by way of their high, but unequal salaries, are too “privileged” to complain. In the end, the women reluctantly accept a settlement when it becomes clear they are unlikely to win. There is little vindication; though modest back pay is awarded and an affirmative action program established, the Times smugly flaunts its “victory.” Robertson summarized the Times public attitude: “We didn’t do it, and we won’t ever do it anymore.”

In this section, the men are outsiders, seen through Robertson’s eyes. Quoting from documents obtained in the discovery phase of the lawsuit, Robertson reveals the blatant, almost cartoonish parody of sexism that we rarely see in workplaces today. A male editor’s response to a colleague recommending a female job candidate: “What does she look like?...Perhaps you ought to send over her vital statistics, or a picture in a bikini?” Another man describing a female employee in the circulation department: “Very pleasant….Her chief ambition is probably to get married. Has a good figure and is not restrained about dressing it to advantage.” 

For the progressive nature of the book, there are moments that feel old fashioned. When Robertson describes Anne McCormick’s unrivaled, head-scratching access to powerful men like Mussolini, she is sure to assure us that her appeal was “not sexual,” as if that would be a reader’s first thought. Descriptions of personal appearances can veer into sentimentality. The Caucus’ lawyer, Harriet Rabb is described as a  “small, pretty, delicate-boned woman with a high, thin, almost babyish voice and the palest varnish of a Southern accent.” 

The book also pays lipservice to the plights of other minorities at the Times, but relegates them as an afterthought. Three years after the Women Caucus’ lawsuit, 15 minority employees sued the Time for racial discrimination, which gets a passing mention. 

At the end of the book, Robertson touches briefly on the future of women at the Times. During the 10 year anniversary celebration of the Women’s Caucus, we learn the original pioneers’ careers have stalled, but that the women coming in after them were succeeding in droves. Speakers included a national editor, the Sunday business editor, and a member of the editorial board. 

Yet, for all the progress, the women noted that sexism evolved. No longer is it so blatant. Instead, it has become the insidious, hard to prove version familiar to professional women today. The national news editor, who had hired a significant number of women to copy edit didn’t believe he constantly interrupted women. When Carolyn Lee becoming the first woman to join the New York Times masthead, Max Frankel, the executive editor welcomed her as an “adornment.” 

One editor said, “We are drowned out, not listened to...The men running the Times now truly do not believe themselves capable of sexist feelings. But they are still looking for, and are only comfortable with people in their own image - in other words, other white men.”

Ultimately, the story of The Girls in the Balcony is the story of first wave feminism at the Times. Fed up with being held back at each stage of their careers, a group of women - mostly wealthy, heterosexual, and white - band together to file the lawsuit of their lives. Though the paper’s ugliest years are behind it, the book serves as an important reminder of the paper’s past.
