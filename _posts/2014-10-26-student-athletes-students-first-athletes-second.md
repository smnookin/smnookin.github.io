If there are athletes at a Division I university renowned for its academics that aren't attending classes, should they really call themselves _student_-athletes? And if this is occurring, is the univeristy failing in its duty? These are questions facing the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, which is one of the best public universities in the country and is also renowned for its national championship-winning basketball and football programs, after scandal struck athletes in both of those sports. 

Among the facts that came to light was a series of ‘ghost classes’: courses in the African American studies department that never actually met and only required one paper, which was often graded as an A regardless of the content. [47% of the students enrolled in these classes were athletes, and 51% of those athletes were football players]( http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/10/22/unc-academic-fraud-case-includes-more-than-students/dntcv3mb3VeAzyAqi00WQM/story.html ). It had previously been disclosed by a former academic counselor from UNC that many of the athletes, especially the football players, [were reading at a 3rd or 4th grade level](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/07/us/ncaa-athletes-reading-scores/). 

I wanted to play NCAA Division I Volleyball, but ultimately I didn't make the cut. Part of the reason I had wanted to be recruited at Division I schools was the guarantee of admission that their coaches could offer me.  If I had been one of the final few chosen, my application would have received a letter of support from the coach, or a gold star somewhere in the corner, indicating that my acceptance letter was already waiting to be stamped and delivered. It would have taken some sort of egregious error in my application, such as a racist remark or homophobic slur, to mar my gold star and throw me in the reject pile.

At bigger athletic institutions such as University of Texas, LSU, or UNC Chapel Hill, almost nothing can keep athletes with that gold star from being admitted. Once they are accepted, however, there is no guarantee that they will receive the same sort of education as their non-athlete peers. Many of the student-athletes admitted through their athletic scholarships are academically capable of handling UNC classes and would have been admitted without a letter of support. Others are not. These less prepared students could be extremely intelligent and naturally gifted, but stunted by a lackluster pre-college education. A 3rd grade reading level is certainly evidence of just that. Some of these athletes are probably coming from [low-income](http://www.ncpanow.org/research/body/The-Price-of-Poverty-in-Big-Time-College-Sport.pdf), low-education backgrounds. Scholarships to universities like this could be a ticket to a better life, except that they are getting pushed through the institution without receiving the education they need to succeed once they graduate. 

UNC is clearly trying to keep these athletes afloat in a difficult academic institution. If players can’t stay above a certain level of units and maintain a certain GPA, then they won’t be eligible, under NCAA guidelines, to play in the big game. Their teams will lose, and [millions of dollars of revenue](http://www.forbes.com/sites/sportsmoney/2011/03/07/duke-louisville-north-carolina-generate-the-most-college-basketball-revenue/)from ticket sales and memorabilia will be lost. This is scary for UNC, so the school does what is necessary to keep its student athletes taking enough units and passing their classes. Unfortunately, UNC does it the easy way, by [padding student-athletes' units, having their professors pass them without merit, or having their counselors write their papers for them](http://www.npr.org/2014/01/06/260265169/unc-may-have-passed-football-players-with-phantom-classes). The university doesn’t do it the hard way -- the right way -- by actually teaching these students what they need to know to succeed in the world. 

At MIT, where I play Division III volleyball now, there is no such guarantee of admission for prospective student athletes. When I was being recruited, my coach specifically told me that I would have to rely on my academics to get in. He could offer a letter of support that would get my application an extra second or two of consideration. This means that, at MIT, our athletics are not nearly as strong as that of UNC. We don't win many (or any) national championships, even playing in Division III. We do, however, thrive academically. MIT athletes don’t get counselors who help us with our papers and assignments. There are no “ghost classes” to help us stay above the unit minimum. Our lives are stressful from balancing athletics and academics. We would probably play a lot better if we didn’t have to stay up until 3:00 am every night working on problem sets. Some of us struggle or end up quitting sports to focus on school, but most of us make it through because we came in capable and prepared. There are programs, such as Interphase and Seminar XL, that help students from a less vigorous academic background hone their skills in the sciences, math, physics and writing before school starts. As a result, MIT has the most overall number of [Academic All Americans in Division III](http://web.mit.edu/athletics/www/department/DAPERQuickFacts09.pdf).

I’m sure that athletes have it just as hard at other top academic and athletic institutions. They may have it even harder, in fact, because their athletic schedules are more demanding than ours. I think MIT’s philosophy of treating athletes the same as any other student academically forces athletes to stay on top of their school work and graduate with the same education and abilities as our non-athlete peers. We have the privilege of being students first, which athletes at these other schools are not afforded. They are expected to dominate on the field or the court and bring in the big bucks through jersey and ticket sales, not to know how to do an integral or formulate a logical argument. More students at these Division I institutions go on to play professionally, but the overall percentage of college athletes who go pro is still [only 1.7% for football players and 1.2% for basketball players](http://www.businessinsider.com/odds-college-athletes-become-professionals-2012-2?op=1). That leaves a huge percentage of athletes that need to be properly educated in order to be successful in professional careers outside of sports.

I propose that universities either admit athletes that have the academic as well as athletic chops to survive, or better educate the admitted athletes that are falling short academically. I think this second option is A) more feasible for the universities and B) more socially responsible. Universities aren’t going to dilute the quality of athleticism in favor of more academically privileged students, because then they won’t get the revenue for funding futher athletic or academic pursuits, such as research. If they can recruit the same level of talent while also properly educating that talent, universities will provide a much better future for athletes who probably won’t go on to the NFL or NBA, and will keep the revenue from sports that can fund other programs within the school.

Athletics within universities can be an extremely enriching experience for students, but we do need to reevaluate how much importance is placed on the athlete versus the student. The primary goal of higher education should be to produce capable, successful members of society, not to fill a stadium with fans or win a gold championship ring.
