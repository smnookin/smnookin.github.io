Can football players at a Division 1 University renowned for its academics who can only read at a third grade level truly call themselves _student_ athletes? University of North Carolina at Chappell Hill is one of the best public universities in the country academically. They also tout national championship winning basketball and football programs. The school has been struck by a scandal surrounding the athletes in both of these sports as well as others. 

It was discovered that there were ‘ghost classes’: courses in the African American studies department that never actually met and only required one paper, which was often graded an A regardless of the content. [47% of the students enrolled in these classes were athletes, and 51% of those athletes were football players]( http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/10/22/unc-academic-fraud-case-includes-more-than-students/dntcv3mb3VeAzyAqi00WQM/story.html ). It had previously been disclosed by a former academic counselor from UNC that many of the athletes, especially the football players, [were reading at a 3rd or 4th grade level](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/07/us/ncaa-athletes-reading-scores/). 

I wanted to play NCAA Division 1 Volleyball (specifically in the Ivy League), but I didn’t make the cut. Part of the reason I had wanted to be recruited at these schools was the guarantee of admission that these coaches could offer me.  If I had been one of the final few chosen, my application would have gotten a letter of support from the coach, or a gold star somewhere in the corner, indicating that my acceptance letter was already waiting to be stamped and delivered. It would have taken some sort of egregious error in my application, such as a racist remark or phobic slur, to mar my gold star and throw me in the reject pile.

At bigger athletic institutions such as University of Texas, LSU, or UNC Chapel Hill, almost nothing can keep athletes with that gold star from being admitted. Once they are accepted, however, there is no guarantee that they will receive the same sort of education as their non-athlete peers. Many of the student athletes admitted through their athletic scholarships are academically capable of handling UNC classes and would have been admitted without a letter of support. Others are not. These less prepared students could be extremely intelligent and naturally gifted, but stunted by a lackluster pre-college education. A 3rd grade reading level is certainly evidence of just that. Some of these athletes are probably coming from [low income](http://www.ncpanow.org/research/body/The-Price-of-Poverty-in-Big-Time-College-Sport.pdf), low education backgrounds. Scholarships to universities like this could be a ticket to a better life, except that they are getting pushed through the institution without receiving the education to succeed once they graduate. 

UNC is clearly trying to keep these athletes afloat in a difficult academic institution. If players can’t stay above a certain level of units and maintain a certain GPA, then they won’t be eligible under NCAA guidelines to play in the big game, the teams will lose, and [millions of dollars of revenue](http://www.forbes.com/sites/sportsmoney/2011/03/07/duke-louisville-north-carolina-generate-the-most-college-basketball-revenue/)from ticket sales and memorabilia will be lost. This is scary for UNC, so they do what is necessary to keep their student athletes taking enough units and passing their classes. Unfortunately, they do it the easy way, by [padding their units, having their professors pass them without merit, or having their counselors write their papers for them](http://www.npr.org/2014/01/06/260265169/unc-may-have-passed-football-players-with-phantom-classes). They don’t do it the hard way, or the right way, by actually teaching these students how to read and write. These universities fail to prepare their athletes for the academic rigor that is required to wear their jersey.

At MIT, where I play Division 3 volleyball now, there is no such guarantee of admission for prospective student athletes. When I was being recruited, my coach specifically told me that I would have to rely on my academics to get in. He could offer a letter of support that would get my application an extra second or two of consideration. This means that, as an Institution, our athletics are not nearly as strong as that of UNC. We don't win many (or any) national championships even though we are two divisions lower than UNC. We do, however, survive academically. MIT athletes don’t get counselors who help us with our papers and assignments. There are no “ghost classes” to help us stay above the unit minimum. Our lives are stressful from balancing athletics and academics. We would probably play a lot better if we didn’t have to stay up until 3:00 am every night working on problem sets. Some of us struggle (occasionally, students and student athletes leave MIT) or end up quitting sports to focus on school, but most of us make it through because we came in capable and prepared.  There are programs, such as Interphase and Seminar XL, that help students from a less vigorous academic background hone their skills in the sciences, math, physics and writing before school starts. As a result, MIT has the most overall number of [Academic All Americans in Division III](http://web.mit.edu/athletics/www/department/DAPERQuickFacts09.pdf).

I’m sure that athletes have it just as hard at other top academic and athletic institutions. They may have it even harder, in fact, because their athletic schedules are more demanding than ours. I think MIT’s philosophy of treating athletes the same as any other student academically forces athletes to stay on top of their school work and graduate with the same education and abilities as our non-athlete peers. We have the privilege, of being students first, that athletes at these other schools are not afforded. They are expected to dominate on the field or the court and bring in the big bucks through jersey and ticket sales, not to know how to do an integral or formulate a logical argument. More students at these Division 1 institutions go on to play professionally, but the overall percentage of college athletes who go pro is still [only 1.7% for football players and 1.2% for basketball players](http://www.businessinsider.com/odds-college-athletes-become-professionals-2012-2?op=1). That’s a huge percentage of athletes that need to be properly educated in order to be successful in professional careers outside of sports.

I propose that either universities admit athletes that have the academic as well as athletic chops to survive, or to better educate the admitted athletes that are falling short academically. I think this second option is A) more feasible for the Universities and B) more socially responsible. Universities aren’t going to dilute the quality of athleticism in favor of more academically privileged students because then they won’t get the revenue for funding futher athletic or academic pursuits, such as research. If they can recruit the same level of talent while also properly educating that talent to subsist without ghost classes and overly helpful academic counselors, they will have provided a much better future to athletes who probably won’t go on to the NFL and NBA, and will have kept the revenue that can fund other programs within the school.

Athletics within universities can be an extremely enriching experience for students, but we do need to reevaluate how much importance is placed on the athlete versus the student. The primary goal of higher education should be to produce capable, successful members of society, not to fill a stadium with fans or win a gold championship ring.
