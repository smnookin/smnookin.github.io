In the summer of 2010, _Rolling Stone_ published a profile of U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal. The piece, written by freelance journalist **Michael Hastings**, was so damning it ultimately resulted in McChrystal's resignation. It was, in the magazine's own words, <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/21W/fa13/21W.737/courseMaterial/topics/topic8/readings/The_Runaway_General/The_Runaway_General.pdf">a piece "that changed history."</a>
