In the past decade, [Massachusetts](http://www.cityofboston.gov/eeos/), along with the rest of the nation, has gone on a Green Energy splurge. With energy independence as their goal, many [companies](http://www.boston.com/business/gallery/massgreencompanies/) are searching for “game-changing” technologies that will disrupt the market. The entrepreneurial leaders of these companies look for novel, sustainable, and reliable forms of energy that have less of an impact on the planet. They invest time and money in research to develop more efficient laptop batteries, wind turbines, solar cells, etc.

Take [A123 Systems](http://www.a123systems.com/), which spun off from a research group at MIT in 2005. A123 hoped to develop a higher-power and faster-recharging lithium ion battery using doped [nanophosphates](http://www.understandingnano.com/batteries.html). Though A123 was not able to prove that the new material was more efficient and as reliable as the current lithium ion battery, its research and development influenced the future of [electric and hybrid cars](http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/chevrolet-to-sell-purely-electric-spark-hatchback-in-u-s/?ref=automobiles) and battery-based energy storage systems.

Next take [Aeronatuica Windpower](http://www.aeronauticawind.com/index.php) and [Ogin Energy](http://www.oginenergy.com/). Both companies sought to develop more efficient and reliable wind turbine technologies. Aeronautica produces stall-regulated wind turbines that could be installed in suburbs for the common consumer, as well as micro grids for large-scale energy production. Ogin produced more compact wind turbines with a lobed two-stage diffuser making turbines more accessible to the every-day consumers. Wind itself is an unreliable source of energy. These turbine technologies have helped [ease CO2 emissions](http://energy.gov/articles/energy-dept-reports-us-wind-energy-production-and-manufacturing-reaches-record-highs) by lessening the dependence on fossil fuels but ultimately, no real disruptive technologies have come out of these companies. 

While A123, Aeronautica, and Ogin have tried to develop revolutionary technologies, none of their ideas have borne edible fruit. The research has led to important discoveries but no wide-spread technological advancements. In the meantime, other companies seek out more incremental approach. 

In an effort to make electricity more reliable, the environmental consulting company [Tetra Tech](http://www.tetratech.com/), in conjunction with Massachusetts and the [SeaLink Project](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2014/10/15/undersea-electric-cables-offer-reliable-option/XZra76spRngJtMhf6UX3PL/story.html), has evaluated a new way to distribute electricity: running electric cables under the ocean to Boston and neighboring suburbs. The electric cables will run along the same path as existing telecom cables. The cables will be continuously monitored with thermal sensors and fiber optics. This prevents extreme weather conditions from affecting the transmission of electricity to those on the grid.  Currently when power lines do collapse due to severe weather, states have to spend a [significant](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/installation-maintenance-and-repair/line-installers-and-repairers.htm) amount of money keeping the [public safe](http://www.mass.gov/eopss/agencies/mema/ready-massachusetts/power-outages-during-cold-weather.html) and happy. Increasing the reliability of electricity increases the efficiency thus decreasing the environmental impact. 

Chevron is another company [tackling environmental issues](http://www.chevron.com/about/ourbusiness/otherbusinesses/technology/). This past summer, as their Materials Engineering intern, I was able to see first-hand how a large company like Chevron has become more environmentally conscious. A company usually so driven by profit margins has taken on the economic burden of making their oil and gas production processes more eco-friendly. The city of Richmond and the state of California have taken notice of the company's commitment to [minimize air pollution](http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/index.aspx?NID=2645). While oil and gas may not be the sexiest industry, people need energy. If large companies make incremental improvements, like Chevron, the effect can be very sizable. 

While developing new "game-changing" technologies is often exciting and more luring, incrementally modifying old ones can often have a larger impact. Companies like Chevron and cities like Boston can take the initiative to lead the way for these incremental advancements. The air quality in California and the reliability of electricity in Boston both have the gratitude of the environment. Developing revolutionary technology consumes time and money. The smaller efforts may just be more worth while.
