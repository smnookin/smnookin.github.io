![SeaLink cable route map.jpg](/_posts/SeaLink cable route map.jpg) In the past decade, [Massachusetts](http://www.cityofboston.gov/eeos/), along with the rest of the nation, has gone on a Green Energy splurge. With energy independence as their goal, some [companies](http://www.boston.com/business/gallery/massgreencompanies/) are searching for “game-changing” technologies that will disrupt the market, while others are trying to incrementally improving existing technologies. 

The entrepreneurs that lead these companies look for novel, sustainable, and reliable forms of energy that have less of an impact on the planet. They have invested time and money in research to develop more efficient laptop batteries, wind turbines, solar cells, etc.

Take [A123 Systems](http://www.a123systems.com/), which spun off from a research group at MIT in 2005. A123 hoped to bring a higher-power and faster-recharging lithium ion battery to the marketplace, but batteries with this new material have not yet proved to be as reliable as the current lithium ion battery. While the company had to file for bankruptcy before reaching their ultimate goal, its research and development influenced the future of [electric and hybrid cars](http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/chevrolet-to-sell-purely-electric-spark-hatchback-in-u-s/?ref=automobiles) and energy storage systems using batteries. 

Then there's [Aeronatuica Windpower](http://www.aeronauticawind.com/index.php) and [Ogin Energy](http://www.oginenergy.com/). Both companies sought to develop more efficient technologies for wind turbines since existing technologies are not nearly as reliable as fossil fuels or natural gas. Aeronautica produces stall-regulated wind turbines that could be installed in suburbs for the common consumer, as well as micro grids for large-scale energy production. Ogin produced smaller wind turbines with a lobed two-stage diffuser that could be installed in smaller spaces making turbines more accessible to the every-day consumers. Since wind is unreliable and therefore cannot be used as a consistent energy source, wind turbines are unable to compete with fossil fuels. However, they have helped [ease CO2 emissions](http://energy.gov/articles/energy-dept-reports-us-wind-energy-production-and-manufacturing-reaches-record-highs) by providing other forms of energy production.

While these companies have tried to develop revolutionary technologies, others seek out more incremental changes. In an effort to make electricity more reliable, the environmental consulting company [Tetra Tech](http://www.tetratech.com/), in conjunction with Massachusetts and the [SeaLink Project](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2014/10/15/undersea-electric-cables-offer-reliable-option/XZra76spRngJtMhf6UX3PL/story.html), has evaluated a new way to distribute electricity: running electric cables under the ocean to Boston and neighboring suburbs. This prevents extreme weather conditions from affecting the transmission of electricity to those on the grid. The cables will run along the same path as existing telecom cables. The electric cables will be continuously monitored with thermal sensors and fiber optics. Part of making energy and electricity more efficient is making it more reliable. In the Northeast, it is especially important to protect electrical lines due to  frequent severe weather conditions. When power lines collapse, states have to spend a [significant](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/installation-maintenance-and-repair/line-installers-and-repairers.htm) amount of money keeping the [public safe](http://www.mass.gov/eopss/agencies/mema/ready-massachusetts/power-outages-during-cold-weather.html) and repairing lines in a timely fashion. 

Chevron is another large company [tackling environmental issues](http://www.chevron.com/about/ourbusiness/otherbusinesses/technology/). This past summer, as a Materials Engineering intern for them, I was able to see first-hand how even large companies like Chevron have become more environmentally conscious. A company usually so driven by profit margins has taken on the economic burden of spending money to make their oil and gas production processes more environmentally friendly. Some say they were forced to do this after a [large fire at their refinery in Richmond, California](https://www.dir.ca.gov/DIRNews/2013/IR2013-06.html). But regardless of why Chevron did it, the city of Richmond and the state of California have taken notice of the company's commitment to [minimize air pollution](http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/index.aspx?NID=2645). Though Chevron has only taken small steps, their impact is quite large. People need energy and still depend on oil and gas. If the large oil and gas corporations make incremental improvements, we could see a large effect.  

While developing new technologies is often exciting and more luring, incrementally changing old ones or established industries can often have a larger impact, especially in the short term. Smaller companies tend to lose funding or be bought out. They do impact the market, but they rarely achieve their end goal. It is a fact that the world is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels. But if companies like Chevron and cities like Boston take the initiative, we could see positive effects on the environment. The air quality in California and the reliability of electricity in Boston have both improved. In some cases, incremental changes can actually be more beneficial to the marketplace than attempts at revolutionary changes.
