Before class starts in a lecture hall, it is typical to see the TA erasing the dusty chalkboards, the Professor organizing their lecture notes, and students getting seated while pulling out their notebooks in preparation for note taking. In a Materials Science class I took last year, in addition to the usual pre-lecture preparation, there were some atypical scenes. At the start of every class, the Professor would attach a wireless microphone to herself while the A&V staff put up lights to illuminate the chalkboards and set up their video camera and viewing screens. Over the course of the semester, every lecture was recorded in preparation for the launch of the class on edX, a non-profit Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform open to any individual with Internet access. 

There had been a lot of buzz around online education. MIT already had [Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), a website where past lectures, notes, problem sets, and exams of a class were posted. Also, other online educational websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) were quickly becoming more popular among college students. Despite the other online educational platforms, edX still caught my attention because it provides more of the entire class experience. Class material is released weekly and there are open discussion forums for all the students to use to ask questions. I volunteered to help my Professor develop the edX version of the class by writing homework questions and editing lecture videos. I currently serve as a TA and Staff Member for the edX class launched which is offered this fall semester. 

As I look at the online version of the class and compare it to my own in-person experience, I notice the obvious setbacks of edX. For me, there was a lab component to the class and a substantial amount of physical Professor and student interaction. The Professor was available at any time to answer questions or re-explain concepts. She was also present during our lab times to help us draw connections between the concepts in class and real-world applications. None of these physical interactions can be replicated online but there are some unexpected advantages to MOOCs.

There are approximately 10,000 students enrolled in the class worldwide. Students range from high school students all the way to professionals who have worked in industry for over 20 years. The lack of homogeneity among the students teaches everyone about different cultures and backgrounds. For example, students in India address the Professor and TAs with Sir or Madam while at the same time they brag about their scores on homework and exams. One student posted about how he “got all of the homework questions correct on his first attempts and thought it was very easy” while other students were simultaneously posting questions regarding the more difficult questions. Though not all experiences are positive, they all serve a learning purpose.

A man from Italy, who has worked in industry as a Materials Scientist for over a decade, registered for this class on edX. He brought a unique perspective to the table as he has worked as a manager for a few years and wanted to brush up on his technical knowledge. He not only completes all of his assignments, but he also goes through the discussion forum and actively answers other students’ questions. Recently, he was given the status of community TA on edX. A community TA is a student who has a good understanding of the course material and frequently answers responds to questions on the discussion forum. He was even so interested in the Professor’s research that he contacted her asking for more information. As the Professor and student started chatting more they realized that they were both attending the same Materials conference in the UK in November. The Professor invited him to lunch to meet and chat. These kinds of introductions and meetings could not happen without edX. No one at MIT would have even known about this Italian Materials Scientist and now and MIT Professor will be meeting him for lunch in a different continent. 

The unexpected perks of MOOCs like edX are not often thought about when evaluating online education. One of the biggest critiques is the lack of social interaction among students, TAs, and Professors. Though this kind of social interaction cannot be emulated online, edX’s large target audience gives rise to more global discussions and meetings of talented scientists which could never come out of traditional schooling.
