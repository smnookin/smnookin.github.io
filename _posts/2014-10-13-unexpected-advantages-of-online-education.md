The scene before class starts in a lecture hall: TAs erasing the dusty chalkboards, the Professor organizing their lecture notes, and students getting seated. In a Materials Science class I took at MIT last year, in addition to the usual pre-lecture preparation, there were some atypical scenes. 

At the start of every class, the Professor would attach a wireless microphone to herself. In the meanwhile, the A&V staff put up lights to illuminate the chalkboards and set up their video camera and viewing monitors. Every explanation, question, and moment of these lectures was recorded in preparation for the launch of the class on edX, a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform. EdX is a non-profit organization that provides free education for any individual with Internet access.

At this time, there had been a lot of [buzz around online education](http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2012/09/why-online-education-has-gained-revolutionary-momentum255/). MIT already had [Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), a website where past lectures, notes, problem sets, and exams of a class were posted. Other online educational websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) were quickly becoming more popular among high school and college students. Despite the other platforms, edX still caught my attention because it provides more of the entire school experience. Class material is released weekly and there are open discussion forums for students to ask questions. I volunteered to help my Professor develop the edX version of this class by writing homework questions and editing lecture videos. I currently serve as a TA and Staff Member for the edX class launched which is offered this fall semester. 

As I look at the online version of the class and compare it to my own in-person experience, I notice the obvious setbacks of edX. For me, there was a lab component where the Professor helped us draw connections between theoretical concepts and real-world applications. The recitation sections, led by graduate students, reinforced ideas taught in class and allowed us to ask clarifying questions in a smaller setting. Though none of these physical interactions can be replicated online, there are some unexpected advantages to MOOCs.

In this edX class, there are approximately 10,000 students enrolled worldwide. Students login from countries including America, Italy, India, China, Bangladesh, Spain, Canada and more. The lack of homogeneity among the students teaches everyone about different cultures and backgrounds. Indian students, for example, address the Professor and TAs with Sir or Madam and tend to brag about their scores on homework and exams. One student posted about how he “got all of the homework questions correct on his first attempts and thought it was very easy” while other frustrated students were simultaneously posting questions regarding the more difficult questions. While this may not have been a positive experience for all, everyone learned something about the rigor and competitiveness of the Indian education system. At a university in any country, the population tends to be more homogenous. This cultural exposure to different communication styles is not emulated as easily on campus.

One unique student registered for the class this semester. This student is from Italy and has worked in industry as a Materials Scientist for over a decade. Having worked as a manager for a number of years know, he hopes to use edX to regain lost technical knowledge. He not only accurately completes all of his assignments but he also peruses the discussion forum and actively answers other students’ questions. Recently, he was given the status of [community TA](https://sites.google.com/site/saasworldtas/edx-ta-guidelines), a helpful and smart student who frequently answers discussion questions. Being very interested in the course, he reached out to the Professor about her current research and recent publications. As the Professor and student started chatting more, both realized they were attending the same Materials conference in the UK this November. He excitedly asked the Professor to join him for lunch to meet and chat about more Materials phenomena. These kinds of introductions and meetings could not happen without online platforms like edX. MOOCs have the ability to shrink the world and connect two strangers based on a common academic interest, something that universities can only have on a small scale.

The unexpected perks of MOOCs like edX are not often thought about when evaluating online education. MOOCs provide the ideal platform for spreading education to those who cannot reach places like MIT. They go on to teach about different cultures and their social norms while connecting academics from around the world. All of these are limited experiences at a university, but on edX the possibilities are surprising and endless.
