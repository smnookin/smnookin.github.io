_The story of Nick Ciarelli, who started a Mac rumor website Think Secret at age 13 then fought for his First Amendment rights against multi-billion dollar company Apple Inc._

**Meet Nick Ciarelli**
	
The Cambridge Innovation Center, located in downtown Kendall Square, is home to more than 700 businesses. Over 500 of those are startups—and it’s a safe bet each one has hard-working and creative entrepreneurs at their helm. One CIC business that is already having some success is the e-book company BookBub, which was launched in 2012 and now employs over 30 people. It was founded two Harvard graduates, Nick Ciarelli and Josh Schanker, in 2012. Although, Ciarelli seems like any other start-up founder in the CIC building, he is actually quite unique. 

At age 13, Ciarelli started publishing his own website, which eventually led to a lawsuit from Apple six years later. It’s hard to picture a teenager peeving Apple Inc. to the point where the billion-dollar company would sue a nineteen year-old college student, but it’s easy to imagine Ciarelli being excited enough about Apple to start an online Mac rumor website, which he named Think Secret.

Ciarelli seems very comfortable in the Cambridge Innovation Center, surrounded by hundreds of other young professionals all working tirelessly to bring their businesses to life. Walking around the fourth floor of the CIC, he smiles and nods at passerby as he describes BookBubs experience at CIC Cambridge. “We’ve been bumped around a couple times. I think we’ve been on three or four floors here already.” He then asked if I’d like any drinks or food as he showed me the floor’s kitchen area, with coffee makers, soda making station, and food selection, all free with the rental space of course.

Sitting down in one of the many meeting rooms, Ciarelli’s looks are not very flashy, he wears a light blue button down and dark blue pants. Short hair but not a buzz cut, tidy but not styled, Ciarelli seems like a pretty normal guy. Growing up in a small town in upstate New York, Ciarelli attended public school in Cazenovia, New York then went on to graduate from Harvard University. 

Although he agreed to speak about his experience as editor-in-chief of Think Secret, Ciarelli seems hesitant at first. He acts as if the fact that he ran a successful and popular Apple reporting site while he was still a minor is no big deal. He is modest about his accomplishments, mentioning that his first attempt at a website was very bad, and explains that Think Secret began as a thirteen year-olds fan site. As he gets deeper into the story Ciarelli starts to explain his experiences more deeply, and he becomes more enthusiastic about telling the story. It’s apparent that he still has some things to say about his past experiences. 

**Think Secret: The Idea**
	
Ciarelli was in eighth grade when he started Think Secret, more as a fan than a reporter. “My parents always bought Apple products,” he says by way of explanation. “It’s kind of hard to believe, but in the late ‘90’s, Apple was in really bad shape,” Ciarelli says. However, in 1997 Apple’s status improved when Steve Jobs was reinstated as CEO and the company started to excite the technology community. Along with Jobs, however, came the secrecy that has become Apple’s trademark. From making designers chain products to their workstations to keeping tabs on employees emails and communications, Apple was been able to keep many of its products under wraps, making Jobs’ product releases all the more exciting. 

For Apple fans like Ciarelli, the wait for the next release was frustrating– so Ciarelli decided to take things into his own hands by researching future Apple products. Think Secret, which was named after one of Apple’s early slogans, “Think Different,” was created so he could publish whatever he found out. While his parents were supportive of what they thought of as their son’s new “hobby,” they were hesitant about him exposing himself online. “Nowadays people are much more comfortable using their real identities online,” said Ciarelli. After considering the fact that sources might be less willing to share information with a teenager and readers might not think of Think Secret as a legitimate reporting outlet, he decided to publish under the pseudonym Nick dePlume. The identity of dePlume would later become a mystery in the Mac Rumor community as Think Secret became more and more respected. 

At the beginning, in 1998, Think Secret was what you might expect from a thirteen year-old boy playing reporter. “I really didn’t know anything when I was starting,” he says. “From the basics of how to write a news story to how to build an Internet business online. “ Ciarelli described his first site as “embarrassing and shoddy,” but as he became more engrossed with the journalistic aspect of the website, he went from playing as a reporter to living as one.

“As a fan I was really excited about what was coming next and then as I started to play around with putting up a site, then at that point I started to get excited with the journalistic aspects of it. At that point, it became much less of a fan thing and more like I was interested in it as a news aspect. That transition was sort of gradual,” Ciarelli explains. He gained more and more sources, eventually becoming one of the most informed and reliable sources for news and rumors about upcoming Apple products. “A couple years into it I started to get excited,” he says. “It wasn’t so much about being an Apple fan, it was more about being excited for the story.”

**Think Secret: Prime Time**

For most people high school is stressful, but Ciarelli describes his experience as “crazy.”

“At that point, it was really hard to get them [high school and Think Secret] to work together,” says Ciarelli. Sometimes he would post a story in the morning and couldn’t check on it until he had a study hall or could slip into the computer lab at school. Looking back, Ciarelli says he thinks it’s a good thing smartphones and wireless Internet access wasn’t available when he was starting out: “I probably would have just been distracted all day, so I guess it worked out.” In addition to doing well in his classes, Ciarelli ran cross-country and track, played piano, and was very involved with his high school drama club. “There weren’t really any journalism extracurricular, but I would have loved to have been on a paper.” 

A close friend of the Ciarelli family, Ron Luteran described Ciarelli as “inquisitive, brilliant, and funny. The kid loved to read.” Luteran was also a teacher at Ciarelli’s high school and described him as an exceptional student. Although Think Secret took up a lot of Ciarelli’s time, Luteran remembers Ciarelli being pretty tight-lipped about his website at school. “He never really talked about it much,” says Luteran. “He was very private about it, and very protective of his sources.” The protectiveness that Ciarelli felt for his sources continued throughout his life, and was a big part of the lawsuit that Apple would eventually serve him. With school and running races, Ciarelli’s absence from Think Secret could sometimes last all day.

“There was really a black hole between the morning when school started and three o’ clock,” Ciarelli explains. “I was constantly shifting back and forth between two different worlds.” As Think Secret started to gain popularity, Ciarelli had to up his game. He enlisted friends to help create a message board, improve the site’s design, and beef up its backend. 

Once Ciarelli started breaking real stories and the website gained readers and fans, he also started receiving legal notices from Apple. “Initially I wasn’t going to fight them,” he says. “So if Apple complained about an article I would take the article down.” But as the volume of threats became greater, Ciarelli turned to his uncle, an attorney in TK, for advice. “He was able to provide me with some advice and basically get me comfortable with the fact that I wasn’t doing anything wrong, that Apple didn’t really have a leg to stand on,” he says. What’s more, cease and desist letters from Apple were widely acknowledged within tech circles as confirmation of the story in question, so Ciarelli became even more confident that he was correct.

Eventually Ciarelli started ignoring the orders altogether. Then, in 2005 Ciarelli correctly predicted the release of the Mac mini two weeks before Steve Jobs formally introduced it. With Ciarelli’s identity still unknown, Apple filed a lawsuit against “Nick dePlume,” alleging that he had illegally induced Apple employees to break their confidentiality agreements.

**Apple vs. Think Secret**

When Apple filed its lawsuit against Ciarelli and Think Secret in January of 2005, Ciarelli was a Harvard freshman focused on final papers and exams. There were two lawsuits involved, one was against Ciarelli as the journalist who had published what Apple claimed was confidential information, and the other was in an effort to reveal Think Secret’s sources. 

Ciarelli got in touch with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization that defends civil liberties in the digital world, supporting free expression, user privacy, and technological development around the world. The group put him in touch with a San Francisco-based lawyer named Terry Gross, who was immediately impressed – he describes Ciarelli as “an amazing man.” At first, Gross said he was too busy to take the case. But when Ciarelli said he’d likely need to shut down the site in order to get Apple to drop the case, Gross agreed to take on the case pro bono.
 
“Once you get a lawyer, everything changes,” says Ciarelli. Several days after the lawsuit was served, Ciarelli was revealed as Nick dePlume in an article in the Harvard Crimson. “I think Apple assumed he was much older,” says Ron Luteran, “and when they found out how young he was I think it kind of knocked them off their heels.” Although Apple never made a statement mentioning their reaction to dePlume’s identity, it must have been a shock. When the media found out that Apple was suing a nineteen-year-old Harvard student, it grabbed hold of the story. “There were a lot of news shows that were asking for him to be on. He had this opportunity for national fame and he just didn’t want to do it,” says Gross. “That showed a substantial amount of wisdom and maturity.” 

When remembering the publicity that occurred during the first week or two when Ciarelli’s identity as dePlume was revealed, Ciarelli lists off some of the newspapers that tried to contact him. “It ended up getting covered in The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and the Associated Press sent out a photographer,” he says. Ciarelli says he was really appreciative of the fact that his case got so much positive press. 

In response to Apple’s lawsuit against Ciarelli, Gross and Ciarelli filed what’s known as an Anti-Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or Anti-SLAPP, suit that claimed Apple was trying to hinder Ciarelli’s First Amendment rights. Apple and Ciarelli agreed on a settlement before the case went to court, and both parties said that the settlement was amicable and they were happy to put the legal battle behind them. 

In the settlement Ciarelli agreed to shut down Think Secret, but more importantly to him was the fact that he was able to protect the identity of his sources. “I always felt that it was really important for journalists to be able to keep the confidentiality of a source,” says Ciarelli. “Any outcome that would put it to rest and not have the identity of my sources revealed was really positive.”

**The Next Chapter**

When Ciarelli shut down Think Secret in February 2008, he ended a project that had been a big part of his life for almost ten years. “Part of why I was happy to be able to settle and move on is because I didn’t want to be running the site for another ten years,” he says. “I was kind of ready to do something else at that point.” 

After graduating from Harvard in 2008 with a bachelor’s degree, Ciarelli accepted a business-side job with the then-new online news site The Daily Beast. “I was also able to contribute a few times to the site and was able to write some stories, so that was a lot of fun,” he says. By 2012, though, Ciarelli and Josh Schanker were ready to start BookBub.

“We had both been really interested in what was going on in e-book publishing and started to get really fascinated by that whole space,” said Ciarelli.  “We started out by helping out this friend with some e-books that she was publishing online and trying to get an audience for them. That’s what got us down the road of BookBub.” BookBub connects authors and publishers to readers through their company. Readers join BookBub for free and receive a daily email featuring limited-time discounts on e-books that match their genre preferences. For the authors and publishers, BookBub promotes the e-book and can expand fan bases greatly. The first service of its kind, BookBub was founded when e-books were gaining popularity and provides a very useful service to both publishers and readers.

Since 2012, Ciarelli and Schanker’s business has gained over 3 million subscribers and claims that 1 in every 50 e-books is purchased with help from BookBub. With its success so far, Ciarelli says his experience with BookBub is going very well. “We’re having a lot of fun here, we have a ton of work to do and we’re still growing. It’s coming up on three years that we’ve been around and we still have a long list of things that we want to do.”  Ciarelli is excited for BookBub to continue moving forward and growing as a business.

Ciarelli’s success in the business world started when he was just a teenager, and it hasn’t stopped since. He has achieved this success without any arrogance or flashiness, but with hard work and great ideas.  His old high school teacher and close family friend said this of him, “He was an exceptional kid, with a really good sense of humor, very modest about his abilities, and we’re all very proud of him and what he’s accomplished.” Based on his accomplishments so far, Ciarelli’s family will have even more to be proud of in the future.
