title: Demystifying MIT’s New Drug Policy
---

Should a student be punished when calling for help? If the emergency is alcohol-related, the MIT administration says no. However, students are not guaranteed the same level of protection for other drugs prohibited by the MIT administration.

Take an incident that occurred several years ago. An MIT student was distributing a substance that the student believed was LSD, but was not. The substance caused several adverse reactions, some resulting in hospitalization, and in response to these emergencies the administration conducted an investigation and apprehended the student responsible. 

	Clearly, in a case such as this, administrative action is to be expected. But, students should not expect the same level of response to every drug-related emergency. 
	For the past several years, the MIT administration has been developing policies to help reduce barriers for students seeking emergency assistance. These policies are designed to ensure students who call for help in an emergency that they are protected from disciplinary action. Following on the heels of a successfully reformed alcohol-related emergency response policy, the latest issue of the Mind and Hand book included a similar policy for drug-related emergencies. This new “Good Samaritan Policy” attempts to mirror the wording of the alcohol Good Samaritan Policy, thereby offering the same level of assurance as the successful alcohol policy.
	There are two main problems. One, the Good Samaritan Policy for drugs does not protect against situations involving “the sale, distribution, enabling the use of (e.g. “spotting”), or sharing of prohibited substances.” Two, there is one crucial line that appears in the drug Good Samaritan Policy that does not appear in the alcohol Good Samaritan Policy: “Each incident will be reviewed to determine if the situation warrants additional administrative or disciplinary action.” This line seems to undermine the entire purpose of the drug Good Samaritan Policy, sewing uncertainty where it should be providing assurances. 
	Don Camelio, director of MIT’s office of Community Development and Substance Abuse, said that “[the policy] doesn’t read exactly the same way, but the spirit of it is actually the same.” He explained that the goal of the policy is “to reduce harm.” By reducing harm, Mr. Camelio seemed to mean that the policy attempts to isolate drug usage, allowing the administration to pursue dealers or other students who would be likely to perpetuate drug use on campus. Mr. Camelio said, “I know that people buy drugs and use drugs together, but that’s different than mass provision to people.”
 	Once again, though, these terms are loosely defined, and some students remain frustrated at the ambiguity of this policy. “This new policy doesn’t really help,” said one MIT sophomore, “because a student who is unsure if they will get in trouble won’t call for help.” Frustration surrounds the explicit banning of “enabling the use of (e.g. “spotting”)” of prohibited substances, an act one MIT junior describes as “specifically designed to make a drug experience safer.” This student continued, “It’s disappointing that they would single out trip sitting because it’s like they’re trying to ban drug use by banning safe drug use.”
	For Mr. Camelio, this is not at all the goal of the policy. “We want to make sure [the policy] works as well as it can possibly work to save people’s lives, and we also want to be able to hold accountable the people who do things that we feel jeopardize the safety of other students.” 
	Mr. Camelio also explained, “There’s a policy group that’s going to be convened again and … should [they] find that the way that this is worded is weak … then they can actually look at it and do it again.” This might be reassuring for students who feel the policy should be updated, but provides no help for students who may remain unsure of where this policy draws the line. 
	As the policy evolves, many students hope to see these issues addressed and corrected, and, in the meantime, they are encouraged to direct any questions they may have about the policy to Mr. Camelio’s office. 
	Referring to the old policy drug policy, one MIT senior said, “I know people who have not called the police specifically because of [the] policy,” and both students and administrators agree that this is the last thing the Good Samaritan Policy should do.
