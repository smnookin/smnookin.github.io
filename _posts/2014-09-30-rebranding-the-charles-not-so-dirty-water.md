When the [Charles River Conservancy (CRC)](http://www.thecharles.org/) first started their [“Swimmable Charles” initiative](http://www.thecharles.org/projects-and-programs/swimmable-charles/) in 2004, some people thought that their slogan was a joke. After all, the 80-mile river, which drains into the Atlantic Ocean from Boston Harbor, served as the inspiration for the Standells 1966 hit "Dirty Water." 

But the CRC was determined to change the Charles’s reputation: If the organization was successful, people would no longer wonder if toxic debris was lurking beneath the surface or if a quick dip would necessitate a tetanus shot. It had already been almost two decades since a 1985 court-mandated cleanup of the Charles, and teams of public and private groups had been working on the issue for years. Today, ten years into the CRC's campaign, the river is remarkably clean and safe -- but it's unclear if the public is fully aware of this.

Sam Wotipka, former intern for the CRC, thinks some people remain skeptical. “I don’t think people appreciate how much cleaner it is, “ he said. “It’s certainly, if you compare it to what it was like in the 1950s, 40s, it’s tremendously cleaner and people are still grossed out by it.” 

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Wotipka's assessment of the Charles' water quality is correct. In 1995, the EPA awarded the river a D grade for the percentage of days per year that the river is deemed safe for swimming and boating. (A safe day means that the levels of _E. coli_ in the water are below set cutoffs -- thereby reducing the chance that contact with the river will cause illness or infection.) The agency's grade for 2013, [awarded just a few weeks ago](http://www.epa.gov/region1/charles/reportcards.html), was an A- -- which meant that least year, the Charles was safe for boating 96% of the time and for swimming 70% of the time. But one yearly EPA report may not put enough useful information out there to change the minds of average person curious about the Charles’s water quality.

Luckily for anyone wanting to spend time in the Charles, the [Charles River Watershed Association](http://www.crwa.org/) (CRWA) is trying to make more information available on how safe the water in the Charles is. The CRWA has developed [a predictive model for water quality](http://www.crwa.org/fieldscience/water-quality-notification) on a day-to-day basis at ten different sites along the 80-mile river. Weekly water samples are taken, and daily predictions are made based on the samples, as well as daily water temperature, wind speed, sunlight levels, and amount of rainfall, all of which can alter _E. coli_ levels. With this model in place, anyone can look up the predicted water quality each day to make an informed decision before any possible river activities – and many people do. Between 0 and 75 people check the CRWA’s predictions every day, and around 175 people are signed up for daily water quality notifications. While the notifications don’t reach every member of the greater Boston area, the reliable system is laying the groundwork for informative opinions on the Charles. 

There are signs that a pair of open swims in the river are changing public opinion as well. In the summer of 2013, the CRWA and CRC worked together to host the first swimming event in the Charles in decades. While the goal of an always-swimmable Charles remains elusive, this open swim (and the follow-up in 2014) was an important landmark for the decades of workers and volunteers, scientists and policy-makers who have fought to regulate the Charles’ water quality. 

Their efforts seem to be noticed – finally – by the Boston community. MIT’s sailing pavilion on the river makes no mention of falling-into-the-Charles concerns, not even in beginner sailing classes, according to current sailing students. The [Charles River’s Yelp page](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-charles-river-boston) has a surprisingly high 4.5/5.0 star rating, and none of the reviews include the word “trash.” 

Elisabeth Cianciola, aquatic scientist at the CRWA, agrees that overall, people are looking more favorably at the river now: “I’ve met the generation who swam in the river without knowing whether or not it was safe to do so, the generation whose perception was that they’d need to go to a hospital if they came into contact with the river, and the newest generation, who sees the sparkling blue water framed by bright green riverbanks and the lack of trash around the river and can’t find a reason not to jump in.”
