When the Charles River Conservancy (CRC) first started their [“Swimmable Charles” initiative](http://www.thecharles.org/projects-and-programs/swimmable-charles/) in 2004, some people thought that their slogan was a joke. After all, the 80-mile river, which meets the Atlantic Ocean in Boston, inspired the Standells 1966 hit "Dirty Water." 

Even before then, fears of toxic debris lurking beneath the surface and legends of precautionary post-swimming tetanus shots were more closely associated with the Charles than any idyllic swimming memories. But the CRC was determined to change the Charles’s reputation.

Since the 1985 court-mandated cleanup of the river, teams of public and private groups have been working to regulate the sewage and wastewater flowing directly into the Charles.** But what the average Bostonian thinks of the Charles is still up for debate – whether people are aware of the current cleanliness of the water or if they still take stock in the storied toxicity of the 1950s-era Charles.** 

Sam Wotipka, former intern for the [Charles River Conservancy](http://www.thecharles.org/), thinks some people remain skeptical. “I don’t think people appreciate how much cleaner it is, “ he said, “It’s certainly, if you compare it to what it was like in the 1950s, 40s, it’s tremendously cleaner and people are still grossed out by it.” 

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the water is undeniably cleaner. In 1995, the EPA began awarding grades for the Charles’ water quality. Their standards for water quality are based on the percentage of days per year that the river is deemed safe for swimming and boating. A safe day means that the levels of _Escherichia coli_ (_E. coli_) bacteria in the water are below set cutoffs. _E. coli_ levels serve as an indicator – higher amounts of _E. coli_ bacteria in the water suggest the presence of other possible contaminants. Whether _E. coli_ or other strains, high bacterial levels can be nasty to come in contact with, potentially causing stomach, skin, or wound infections. 

While bacteria levels seem worrisome, they no longer stand in the way of the CRC’s goal of a swimmable Charles. Since the first grade (a “D”) in 1995, the Charles has gotten progressively cleaner; the EPA [awarded an A- grade](http://www.epa.gov/region1/charles/reportcards.html) just a few weeks ago. This A- grade for 2013 was based on the Charles being safe for boating 96% of the time and for swimming 70% of the time – quite the change from the 1995 safety levels of only 39% for boating and a terrifyingly low 19% for swimming. But one yearly EPA report may not put enough useful information out there to change the minds of average person curious about the Charles’s water quality.

Luckily for anyone wanting to spend time in the Charles, the [Charles River Watershed Association](http://www.crwa.org/) (CRWA) is trying to make more information available on how safe the water in the Charles is. The CRWA has developed [a predictive model for water quality](http://www.crwa.org/fieldscience/water-quality-notification) on a day-to-day basis at ten different sites along the 80-mile river. Weekly water samples are taken, and daily predictions are made based on the samples, as well as daily water temperature, wind speed, sunlight levels, and amount of rainfall, all of which can alter _E. coli_ levels. With this model in place, anyone can look up the predicted water quality each day to make an informed decision before any possible river activities – and many people do. Between 0 and 75 people check the CRWA’s predictions every day, and around 175 people are signed up for daily water quality notifications. While the notifications don’t reach every member of the greater Boston area, the reliable system is laying the groundwork for informative opinions on the Charles. 

There are signs that a pair of open swims in the river are changing public opinion as well. In the summer of 2013, the CRWA and CRC worked together to host the first swimming event in the Charles in decades. While the goal of an always-swimmable Charles remains elusive, this open swim (and the follow-up in 2014) was an important landmark for the decades of workers and volunteers, scientists and policy-makers who have fought to regulate the Charles’ water quality. 

Their efforts seem to be noticed – finally – by the Boston community. MIT’s sailing pavilion on the river makes no mention of falling-into-the-Charles concerns, not even in beginner sailing classes, according to current sailing students. The [Charles River’s Yelp page](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-charles-river-boston) has a surprisingly high 4.5/5.0 star rating, and none of the reviews include the word “trash.” 

Elisabeth Cianciola, aquatic scientist at the CRWA, agrees that overall, people are looking more favorably at the river now: “I’ve met the generation who swam in the river without knowing whether or not it was safe to do so, the generation whose perception was that they’d need to go to a hospital if they came into contact with the river, and the newest generation, who sees the sparkling blue water framed by bright green riverbanks and the lack of trash around the river and can’t find a reason not to jump in.”
