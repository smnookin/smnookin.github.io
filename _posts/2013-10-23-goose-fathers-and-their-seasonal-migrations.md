## Goose Fathers and Their Seasonal Migrations

![](http://karthijaygee.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/flok-of-birds-v-formation.jpg)

It’s not surprising that working parents often don’t have much time to spend with their children during the week. But in East Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, some kids don’t see their fathers for days, or even weeks, at a time. In an article from Chosun News last spring, South Korean students were interviewed about their families and what the reporters discovered was alarming – some of the students barely knew their fathers. One of the students had drawn a picture of her family, but it only included mom, little brother and herself. When asked where her father was, she calmly stated, “At work.” In extreme cases, some children don’t even live in the same home as their father. While these cases don’t necessarily represent South Korea as a whole, they are becoming more prominent and are a product of the country’s rigid educational system. 
I can count the number of times per week that my family eats dinner together using less than two fingers, but my family wasn’t always like this. Before I went to high school, my family ate dinner together almost every day of the week. During my freshman year of high school, my dad decided to move back to South Korea, as he and my mom had planned to move back once I graduated anyway. For the next three years, my mom brought me to school, piano lessons, orchestra rehearsals, and did the best she could as a single parent. Then, after my sister and I both moved to Boston for college, my mom moved here as well. Now we see my dad once a year. Most of our interactions come in the form of the money he sends us throughout the year.
	There’s an affectionate term for these types of dads in South Korea. “Gireogi appa,” which translated literally means “Goose father,” is the term for a South Korean man who works in South Korea while his wife and children stay in an English-speaking country for the sake of the children’s education. The term was inspired by the fact that geese are a species that migrate, just as the father must travel a great distance to see his family. There are currently up to 200,000 goose fathers in South Korea, and of the many students, more than 40,000 are living without their fathers in developed English-speaking countries such as the United States, England, Canada, or New Zealand to increase their English-speaking abilities. 
	Education is of paramount importance in South Korean culture and society. That’s why South Korea has become one of the most highly educated and competitive countries in the world, with approximately 40% of the population holding a post-secondary degree, an amazing achievement for a country that had been ravaged by a civil war less than 60 years ago. 
	But this culture has also given rise to an extremely rigorous educational system. The university entrance exam is so critical to a student’s future that on exam day, parents crowd churches and temples, office buildings open later so that students can get to their exam on time, and airplanes are grounded to reduce noise. Unsurprisingly, students crack under the pressure – South Korea has the highest student suicide rate in the world. 
	While there are certainly benefits to studying abroad, the benefits alone would not be enough to uproot families. The benefits, along with a dissatisfaction with South Korea’s rigid education system, leads many parents to move to other countries, hoping to spare their children from this intense pressure. For all of its educational success, this shows that the success of the Korean educational system comes with a very real price. The increasing percentage of goose families is an example of the extent to which parents believe education is important but don’t want to risk their children sacrificing their futures.
	Is it necessary? Are the benefits worth splitting up the family? The cost of maintaining two households has stretched family budgets and strained marriages. The families also face unexpected emotional hardships that come with a child living apart from a parent, a mom struggling to adjust to a new language and culture and a dad living alone while working to send as much money as possible to his family, only to come home to a dark, empty house. 
	Even though we may be leading lives that are too hectic for daily family time, it’s important to at least have dinner together. Dinner is a time to share about one’s day and its ups and downs and sacrificing this time for the sake of education can have tough consequences. It’s been 6 years since my dad started living in Korea alone, and the total number of days I’ve seen him is less than 50. The other day, he said there were flies in the kitchen when he got back from his office. “I was going to kill them, but decided not to because I was feeling lonely.” Soon, the house will be filled with flies.
