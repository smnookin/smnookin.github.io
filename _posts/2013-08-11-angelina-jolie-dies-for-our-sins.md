A feature-writer [paints a picture of Angelina Jolie] (http://www.esquire.com/women/women-we-love/angelina-jolie-interview-pics-0707#img) as "the best woman in the world." The piece -- later brutally critiqued by Slate -- writes that "the word that best describes her is a word the religion of celebrity has made difficult to say, and more difficult to swallow: Good."
