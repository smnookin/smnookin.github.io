A major component of CMS.350/21W.737 is the course's website, which will serve both as a tool for exploring how to entice readers to spend time with our work and as a central repository for readings, details about class assignments, and other ephemera. 

The website was designed using some very simple tools -- <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> com for the backend architecture, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com" target="_blank">Foundation</a> for the design, <a href="http://prose.io" target="_blank">Prose</a> for text editing, and <a href="http://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> for collaboration management. Students are not required to have any familiarity with these tools -- we will discuss the best ways to use them as a group during class -- but you are required to sign up for <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> and <a href="http://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> accounts.
