A major component of CMS.350/21W.737 is the course's website, which will serve both as a tool for exploring how to entice readers to spend time with our work and as a central repository for readings, details about class assignments, and other ephemera. 

The website was designed using some very simple tools -- github.com for the backend architecture, foundation.zurb.com for the design, and prose.io for text editing. Students are not required to have any familiarity with these tools -- we will discuss the best ways to use them as a group during class.
