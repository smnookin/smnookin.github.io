![](http://archpaper.com/uploads/image/bell-labs-archpaper-02.jpg)A 2-million sq ft mirrored glass box stands dilapidated in the suburbs of Holmdel, New Jersey. Inside, there is a breathtaking quarter-mile long, 6-storey high atrium, but what was once the center of cutting edge science research and development now sees more familiar faces in small rodents and weeds. The former Bell Laboratories complex was one of Finnish architect Eero Saarinen’s last projects. It was completed in 1962, at a time when corporate labs were generously funded to conduct research, and their architectures, large-scale buildings usually situated in the suburban landscape, could begin to form their own typology. It operated for 44 years as a site of basic research, which garnered some of its most significant discoveries– the transistor and the laser– and multiple Nobel prizes in physics. 

The lab was officially shut down in 2008, and sold to Somerset development for adaptive reuse as a mixed-use town center for the surrounding community. Potential programs include retail, shopping and restaurants, a health and wellness center, a hotel and conference center, educational facilities, a high-end spa, and other public facilities. Although there was some push against preserving the building in initial discussions– some argued that a full redevelopment from scratch would result in a better payoff– its addition to the Cultural Landscape Foundation’s list of Most Endangered Historic Sites in New Jersey, as well as strong advocacy from former lab employees for the building’s restoration, has saved it from demolition. 

In an interview by the National Trust of Historic Preservation with president of Somerset Development, Ralph Zucker, Zucker likened the building to a mini-city, arguing that “the days when a single tenant could occupy the building have passed” and touting its suitability to a wide range of programs. It would serve as a civic space for a new residential development of 225 single family homes adjacent to the building. The atrium would be transformed into a public, pedestrian promenade. One look at the plans and initial renderings, however, is all it takes to show that the spirit of Saarinen’s design is wholly lost in its conversion to what is essentially a suburban mall. The atrium and configuration of open corridors was planned as a social gathering space for scientists to exchange ideas as they moved to and from offices. As soon as the offices are proportioned off to separate businesses, the atrium loses its charge as a truly communal space.

The adaptive reuse of outdated typologies such as industrial factories and warehouses into new residential types and art/cultural spaces has been very successful in recent years. While there is value in preserving the physical structure of these buildings merely to provide the public a unique, spatial experience, the types of programs that they serve remain conventional. More thought should go into how the renewal of these old buildings can be simultaneously an opportunity to mix programs in a new way, and to seek out potential overlaps between cultural, residential, academic, and work space.       

Bell Labs has escaped the guillotine, but the moment, it is looking towards a rather mundane second life.
