Three in the morning and the buildings of MIT are, for once, pretty much silent. Walking up the steps and into an empty Lobby 7, you can just barely hear the _tweet-tweet-drum_ from the walk signal Mass Ave, and the faint hum of floor-cleaners at work polishing the hallways to a dull, dirt-free sheen. An extra noise is audible: there's a distinct patter emanating from the Infinite Corridor, which is the main artery for foot-traffic among academic buildings. Halfway down, the Infinite opens into Lobby 10, and to your left is an antechamber with elevators, along with the source of the noise. 

Standing there is a man with a ponytail and goatee. He wears black pants and a blue button-down, and keeps an e-cigarrette on hand. His head is bowed in concentration, at the floor in front of him, where his hands are directing seven red balls to patter against the floor in a quick-paced rhythm. He is juggling.

"You know juggling is really good for your brain. Studies have shown that it's good for your brain."

The first thing you realize when you go talk to Nicholas Ferri is that he really likes juggling. Every sentence out of his mouth ends with a tidbit about why juggling is important for the body, mind and soul. His dedication goes far enough that he prefers to go by his stage name, Smyly the Juggler. And you wouldn't know it looking at him, but he has been practicing late-night juggling, every week, at MIT for the last twenty-four years, since 1990.

At twelve years old, Smyly worked near Quincy Market in downtown Boston as a shoe-shine boy. Shoe shining wasn't a particularly popular profession, so a young Smyly began to learn tricks and skills from the other local vendors, including the art of juggling. In short order, he then found the MIT Juggling Club, which met regularly at the Institute, and he's been practicing his craft in Lobby 10 ever since.

In the interim years, Smyly's nocturnal presence has made him a regular in the Infinite, as well as a friend to the janitorial staff and the campus police alike. He has come to serve as the de facto guardian of Lobby 10, which itself acts as a World War I memorial. If people try to disrespect the environment, Smyly handles them. "Doing something—bouncing something off the wall? You don’t do that, it’s a memorial. Writing something on the wall? You don’t do that," said Smyly. When a little over a year ago there was a threat of a potential gunman on campus, the police let Smyly know, who informed them that he stood ready to throw a juggler's club if necessary.

What's particularly amazing about Smyly's status in the Infinite is how he holds no connection to MIT itself. He has never been a student; he's never been a TA for a class; he's not in the MIT directory. He comes back each week to meetings of the MIT Juggling Club, which does not possess any current student members. The Juggling Club was founded back in the 70s by then-MIT-student Arthur Lewbell, and the club has remained within MIT's halls ever since. Smyly himself is only affiliated through this non-student club: how, then, can he be allowed on campus so late at night?

The answer lies in MIT's open campus policy, which allows the public to roam the Institute’s hallways without escort or a limit to visiting hours. This allows for streams short-term guests that MIT sees on a daily basis, but also grants someone like Smyly the ability to spend his nights practicing his craft within the Infinite. Some have voiced concerns about campus safety in light of the policy, but Smyly isn't worried, saying, "Not a lot of people who don’t go to school here come here, unless they’re doing something malicious, but you know everyone looks out for each other here at MIT, which is why you can have that open campus thing."

Almost a quarter of a century after first juggling in the Infinite, Smyly the Juggler stays through the early morning and protects his corner of a college which has come to adopt him, despite no direct link. "I was here juggling last night until probably 4:30, didn't get to bed until six in the morning," said Smyly, "I go home, I watch the Cleveland Show, I go to bed, you know? *chuckles* Cleveland Show, that's my show." Before saying good night, however, he made a point to invite me to an upcoming juggling event. I'm sure it will be educational, especially given all of juggling's beenfits.
