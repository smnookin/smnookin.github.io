title: Solving Climate Changes as a MIT Community
---


Climate Colab, for the first time, partnered with MIT Solve to bring together people from all over the world to MIT to address and tackle the climate change together as a community. The Climate Colab Conference, Crowds & Climate, was held at October 6th, 2015 on the 2nd floor of the Student center at MIT. The event brought leaders from non-profit organizations, government and policy people, and people from around the world that were passionate about taking the problems of climate change into action. 

For this year’s conference, participants at the Crowds & Climate were invited to participate in Solve’s events. Solve is MIT’s new cross-disciplinary leadership program initiated by the Institute’s Office of the President and produced by MIT Technology Review. 

                                 

Laur Fisher, the Climate Colab project manager, said that “We are really excited about Solve and we agree with President Reif when he says that MIT can be a place that people come to work on solving problems and MIT is a really uniquely positioned for that.  So we really look forward in working with MIT and other groups to have do some massive world problem solving.”

The MIT Climate Colab is an online community and has around 50,000 members. It was founded by Professor Thomas W. Malone who is the founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. The annual conference hosted by the Climate Colab, is part of the project initiated by Professor Thomas W. Malone to bring more awareness to the climate changes and to help combat it with actions. 

The conference started off with a welcoming message by Professor Thomas W. Malone and then proceeded to keynote panhel discussions. Then, the conference recognized the 2015 Climate CoLab winners, which were announced in September of this year. Then, the conference broke off into breakout sessions with the winners’ presentations and the expert panels and then moved unto interactive workshops. In these interactive workshops, attendees of the conference were able to meet and work with the Climate CoLab winners. 

The new aspect of the conference was that the conference this year focused more on the interactive aspect of the program. Laur Fisher, the Climate Colab project manager says how they made adjustments for this conference. 

“Every year we take feedback from our members, the people who attend, and our winners and we try to make [the conference] a little bit better. So this year, we focused on making sure our winners got the connections that they needed. And [for them] to have more time to have conversations and networking to build action. In previous years, we had a lot of primary panels where people were speaking on stage. This year we did have one primary panel but for the most part it were breakout sessions and then interactive workshops where people could actually work and talk together.”

This new aspect of the conference was a positive change. Danielle Dahan, the Grand Prize Winner for the 2014 Climate Colab Conference, expressed her thoughts on this new change: 

“[This year] they helped the winners get more support for the winners. Last year once you won you had all of the contacts from the conference and you had people to talk to but there was no formal process after you won. You could drop the project or pursue it on your own. But this year they implemented more ways that they keep in contact with the winners and have one on one support with them to help them pursue their projects.”
                      

In the interactive workshops, there were many inspiring ideas about how to combat the climate change in this world. One of the ideas was how to mobilize the elders to educate the youth about the global climate change. Linda Zhang, the committee chair for MIT Undergraduate Association Sustainability Committee, expressed what she gained out of attending the conference. She said, “I learned so much at this conference. I thought the discussions were really interesting as the people in the group were not the people I would normally see. They had a very different perspective and brought up topics that I had not thought about. I never really thought about how to mobilize elders and how to involve elders in helping change the climate issue.” 

This new aspect of putting a focus on the interactive workshops in the conference helped bring more ideas into a collaborative environment to move forward. 

The goal of the Climate CoLab is for the conference to not be just a place to learn and absorb information. It is great to absorb and learn information, but they want to help bring into actions that will solve the climate change problems.

 Laur Fisher explains how the goal of the Climate CoLab in holding these conferences is to help the attendees interact with the people and to move the ideas forward. She says “it really is a place to be inspired by what’s happening and to talk with others about action that can actually happen. So in our conference, you hear from the winners and you just don’t just hear from them. You get to engage with them, help work with them, and share your ideas on how they could actually move forward for implementing their work. So you are not just sitting there being inspired by this great work that’s being done, but you have the actual opportunity to directly support the work that’s being done.”

The Climate Colab conference this year was a success as it gathered 200 people from all over the world to collaborate with each other. In order for the improvements for the Climate Colab conference next year, Laur Fisher says that, “it is important to have a digital and an online component of the conference” so that a lot of people who cannot attend the conference either for time or for financial reasons can be supported by opening up the platform to attend virtually. 
 
Danielle Dahan, the Grand Prize Winner for the 2014 Climate Colab Conference, also expressed her hopes for next year’s conference. She said “They do an awesome job in reaching out to people, but there are so many good ideas out there that aren’t really harnessed and people don’t really have a place to express them.” She hopes that Climate CoLab will continue to reach out to more people all over the world and get more ideas each year. And then following up with the winners with resources on how to connect them with some of the obstacles that they are facing as they move on with the project. 

 

The efforts of the Climate Colab and the initiative started by SOLVE shows how MIT is moving progressively to becoming a leader in helping implement world problems such as climate change. Hopefully, this positive momentum will be carried out after the conference to provide more conversations in the MIT community to help better the environment of this world we live in.
