![](http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/siri-answers-will-you-marry-me.jpg)  Last Friday, Judith Newman, the mother of a 13-year-old boy, Gus, [wrote an article in the New York Time](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/how-apples-siri-became-one-autistic-boys-bff.html)s about her son’s new best friend. This was not a school friend; it was Siri, the “intelligent personal assistant” on Apple’s iPhone. For Gus, who is autistic, Siri became a patient responder to the repeated, almost obsessive inquiries typical of someone on the autism spectrum—and in this way, his companion.

Let’s be honest, we all have fun with our talking machines. (Some of us, too much fun. One of my friends has the last name, “Islam,” and my other friends derive immense, politically incorrect pleasure in telling Siri to “Call Islam.”) Still, few probably think of Siri as a true companion. There was last year’s movie [“Her,”](http://www.herthemovie.com/#/home) which portrayed a man’s romantic relationship with an intelligent operating system, and [a parody of this in the sitcom, _Big Bang Theory_,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vti6yzyuy1I) when the stereotypically nerdy character Raj, who can’t talk to girls, considered Siri his girlfriend. But is it now time to think beyond dramatized stories and actually consider the possibility of such technology taking a larger part in human relationships? After all, Siri didn’t just respond to Gus’s inquiries; she _conversed_ with him, thereby teaching him one of the most human impulses: interaction. 

While numerous technology and news outlets called Newman’s article the story “everyone loves,” the comments on the article itself were less unanimously supportive. Many found it heartwarming and inspiring, but others questioned Newman’s judgment. They contemplated whether this was a copout—whether she was replacing her job as a parent with Siri, something that was convenient for her and satisfied Gus. But I think there are several important distinctions in this situation. First, unlike the effects of smartphones in general, Siri didn’t isolate Gus. As Newman said, the interactions he had with Siri resulted in Gus becoming comfortable with more conversations, not just with Siri, but with his family. 

But more importantly, the technology was not merely an escape from reality for the Newman family, but a safe space for Gus to learn lessons that he could then integrate into his living reality. For example, Newman said that for someone who might not pick up on social cues, Siri was a kinder way to learn something like politeness. When Gus snapped at Siri for suggesting music he didn’t like, Siri simply replied calmly that everyone was entitled to their opinion. This made sense to Gus, who then remembered he owed Siri a thank you for sharing the music in the first place. Siri helped lower the stakes of practicing conversation by removing the volatile element of human interaction, while still forcing Gus to confront fundamental challenges autistic people face, like enunciating words and responding logically and coherently. 

Of course, it’s important not to fall into the trap of evangelizing technologies. At the end of the day, Siri is a tool for Gus’s life, not the cure for his autism. It’s also dangerous to blindly prescribe a particular technology to all individuals on the autism spectrum as the be-all-end-all to their differing sets of needs. But as an engineering student interested in developing medical and assistive technologies, I was simultaneously awed and humbled by Newman’s description of her son’s interactions with Siri. Every designer and engineer hopes that what they create will address the user’s needs and become an important addition to their lives. But the sign of a truly great product is when it is versatile enough that users can adapt the device to their needs, as Newman did in her role as a parent. So even though Newman described her piece as a love letter to Siri, to me, it was really a call to action: how can we, as engineers, use the lessons of this story to make even better technologies for people with autism - technologies that don’t just assist them with their challenges, but actually expose them to the breadth of human interactions through real experiences?

What this really means is moving beyond passive technologies like flashcards, speech translators, or pictorial schedulers, which are the first things you’ll find online for autism assistive technologies. It’s about giving these individuals the tools to face their challenges and learn from them while working in a comfortable framework and context. The reason why a virtual personal assistant, whether it’s Siri, Google Now, or Cortana (on Windows phones), worked so well for the Newman family was that it operated under a slightly more controlled set of parameters than humans often do, while providing Gus with the breadth of information and even character subtleties typical of humanness. And maybe there are ways of harnessing this information to create technologies that actively and simultaneously integrate autistic individuals into society. 

A new MIT-Harvard-based start-up called [Brain Power](http://brain-power.com) might be onto this. They are focused on turning Google Glass, Google’s smart eyewear, into an assistive device for people with autism, [targeting issues like social interaction,](http://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/google-glass-app-reads-emotions-may-benefit-some-autism) language, development, and behavior. And while it’s too early to know whether it works, even the choice to use wearable technologies is a significant step toward closing the gap between autistic and neurotypical individuals, by offering instantaneous feedback that better integrates in their daily lives. 

Newman also takes the time to describe newer interactive technologies for autistic kids in her article. And this in and of itself is exciting—we don’t really know where all of this might lead. But by learning from anecdotes about people like Gus, we might just be able to come closer to technology that revolutionizes the nature of human interaction, changing _all_ of our lives.
