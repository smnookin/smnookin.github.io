Students from across the country, including 70 from MIT, jammed downtown New York on Sunday, September 21st. Along with them were social justice organizations and labor unions, scientists and faith groups, monks and farmers, vegans, pagans, and marching bands. A church group’s ark-shaped float blasted “Respect” by Aretha Franklin. A man on all fours in a business suit dripped sweat as he dragged a smoking pan of dry ice through the streets. The crowd flowed down Central Park West and crushed itself between the billboards of Times Square.

MIT students from [Fossil Free MIT](http://www.fossilfreemit.org/) carried signs reading “Youth Choose Climate Justice” and “MIT Stands With Science”.

At 12:58 PM, a hush descended. Arms raised as [400,000](http://time.com/3415162/peoples-climate-march-new-york-manhattan-demonstration/) marchers observed a moment of silence for those already directly affected by climate change. Near the front of the march were the victims of the massive damage caused by hurricane Sandy, which hit the Caribbean and the Northeastern United States in 2012 and became the [largest Atlantic hurricane](http://www.erh.noaa.gov/mhx/EventReviews/20121029/20121029.php) ever recorded.

At 1:00 PM, a wave of noise propagated through the thronged streets. 400,000 howled together in a moment of alarm, to symbolize the urgent need for action.

Patrick Brown didn’t expect such a turnout at the People’s Climate March, from the MIT community or in general. The MIT vans filled up, and Brown had to scramble to find transportation for last-minute marchers. “It’s a good problem to have,” he said.

Brown heads Fossil Free MIT, a campus environmental activism group. Since 2012, Fossil Free has been urging the MIT administration to stop investing the school’s endowment in fossil fuel companies. The divestment petition now has over 2700 signatures. The club also helps MIT students get involved in environmental activism through events like the march.

The People’s Climate March was the largest climate demonstration in history. It happened just as world leaders met in New York in advance of the 2015 climate conference in Paris. The march was meant to push for a binding international agreement to curb carbon emissions.

“I’ve done all the little things, like turning off the lights,” said Alexa Strobel, who came to the march with Fossil Free MIT, “I wanted to do something significant. The march is significant because people are going to notice.”

At MIT, Fossil Free’s environmental message is taking hold. On September 19, Maria Zuber, MIT’s Vice President for Research, emailed all of MIT about the beginning of a campus-wide climate conversation. A new committee will “seek broad input from the Institute community on how the US and the world can most effectively address global climate change. The Conversation should explore pathways to effective climate mitigation, including how the MIT community – through education, research and campus engagement – can constructively move the global and national agendas forward,” she wrote.

This conversation is part of what Fossil Free has been pushing for. The goal of divestment is to get people talking, and to use MIT’s international standing to bring attention to the problem.

“We don’t think that by divesting we’ll bankrupt these [fossil fuel] companies,” said Patrick Brown. “It’s really more about exposing the link between these companies… and disinformation about climate change, and political lobbying against climate change action.”

“We don’t want to be part of that business plan,” he said.

At the end of the march, people clogged 11th Avenue. Some sat on the sidewalk, after five hours of marching. Others danced.

As the Fossil Free contingent posed for a group picture, a man passing by said to his companion: “Look at that. If MIT’s with us, who can be against us?”!
