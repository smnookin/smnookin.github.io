On Sunday, September 21, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in midtown Manhattan. There were monks and farmers; vegans, pagans, and marching bands; social justice organizations and labor unions; scientists and faith groups. The Aretha Franklin anthem "Respect" blared from an ark-shaped float; nearby, a man in a business suit dripped sweat as he crawled down the street dragging a smoking pan of dry ice.

Thousands of students also joined this motley crowd, which was gathered for the [People's Climate March](http://peoplesclimate.org/wrap-up/), an effort to spur global action on climate change. Seventy members of [Fossil Free MIT](http://www.fossilfreemit.org/) had traveled from Boston that weekend; they carried signs reading “Youth Choose Climate Justice” and “MIT Stands With Science."

The march, which was scheduled to coincide with [the UN Climate Summit 2014](http://www.un.org/climatechange/summit/), aimed to draw attention to global inaction on climate policy. At 12:58 PM, the 400,000 protesters raised their arms and [observed a moment of silence](http://time.com/3415162/peoples-climate-march-new-york-manhattan-demonstration/) for those already directly affected by climate change. Near the front of the march were the victims of the massive damage caused by hurricane Sandy, which hit the Caribbean and the Northeastern United States in 2012 and became the [largest Atlantic hurricane](http://www.erh.noaa.gov/mhx/EventReviews/20121029/20121029.php) ever recorded.

Two minutes later, the silence was broken by an eruption of howls, as the crowd shouted in unison, giving voice to the urgent need for action.

Patrick Brown, the head of Fossil Free MIT, didn’t expect such a turnout at the People’s Climate March, from the MIT community or in general. When the MIT vans filled up, Brown had to scramble to find transportation for last-minute marchers. “It’s a good problem to have,” he said.

Since 2012, Fossil Free has been urging the MIT administration to stop investing the school’s endowment in fossil fuel companies. The divestment petition now has over 2700 signatures. The club also helps MIT students get involved in environmental activism through events like the march.

The People’s Climate March was the largest climate demonstration in history. It happened just as world leaders met in New York in advance of the 2015 climate conference in Paris. The march was meant to push for a binding international agreement to curb carbon emissions.

“I’ve done all the little things, like turning off the lights,” said Alexa Strobel, who came to the march with Fossil Free MIT, “I wanted to do something significant. The march is significant because people are going to notice.”

At MIT, Fossil Free’s environmental message is taking hold. On September 19, Maria Zuber, MIT’s Vice President for Research, emailed all of MIT about the beginning of a campus-wide climate conversation. A new committee will “seek broad input from the Institute community on how the US and the world can most effectively address global climate change. The Conversation should explore pathways to effective climate mitigation, including how the MIT community – through education, research and campus engagement – can constructively move the global and national agendas forward,” she wrote.

This conversation is part of what Fossil Free has been pushing for. The goal of divestment is to get people talking, and to use MIT’s international standing to bring attention to the problem.

“We don’t think that by divesting we’ll bankrupt these [fossil fuel] companies,” said Patrick Brown. “It’s really more about exposing the link between these companies… and disinformation about climate change, and political lobbying against climate change action.”

“We don’t want to be part of that business plan,” he said.

At the end of the march, people clogged 11th Avenue. Some sat on the sidewalk, after five hours of marching. Others danced.

As the Fossil Free contingent posed for a group picture, a man passing by said to his companion: “Look at that. If MIT’s with us, who can be against us?”
