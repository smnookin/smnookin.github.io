title: "Goodbye, Mobile Ads"

This month, Apple introduced a small change in the operating system that runs the iPhone that could require major changes for digital publications. iOS, Apple's mobile operating system, introduced a new feature that allows ad blocking on iPhones. Web publishers often rely on advertisements for revenue, while many users want to avoid ads as much as possible. iOS’s new feature lets users fight back against ads on phones for the first time.

Many articles that you read online are paid for by advertising. These advertisements can come in the form of pop-up ads, side images, sponsored links, and more. Companies pay online publishers to show ads to the readers, which allow articles to be seen for free. However, this comes with some very clear downsides.

Now, iPhone users can download apps that block 3rd party advertisements on any web page. This can create an ethical dilemma for consumers, because by blocking ads, they are preventing publishers from monetizing their product. If everyone used ad-blockers, many publishers would likely go out of business. While content blocking has been possible on desktops for many years, the introduction of the feature on iPhone poses a bigger problem to publishers because a large portion of people read news on their phones, and iPhone has over 50% of mobile web usage.

Besides just being visually distracting, online advertisements cause a number of other problems — especially on mobile devices. Advertisements make articles slower to download, and also take up a large amount of bandwidth — which can be quite costly to readers. For example — according to the New York Times — advertisements on Boston.com makes pages take over 3 times longer to load than while blocked.

Using an ad-blocker on the iPhone is very compelling. It will remove the visual image of the ad. It will make the article you are reading load faster. It will save you money on data costs. It will improve your battery life by decreasing the number of scripts running. And finally, it will prevent ad networks from recording a history of what sites you visit.

Developers have already written dozens of content blocking apps. The justification from many of the developers is that advertisements that track user behavior (without asking) are unethical enough to justify blocking them.

However, it’s unclear that tracking is the biggest issue users have with ad-blockers. In a small polling of MIT students who use ad-blocking, the reason they used blockers was almost always because the visual ads were “annoying” or “frustrating.” Out of 15 students at MIT that said they used ad-blockers, none of them gave the reason that they had concerns about privacy and tracking.

One MIT student, Colin McDonnell, gave a justification for the use of ad-blocking. He said that he “…would much rather pay a subscription than have to deal with ads everywhere. Since [publishers] don’t give an option to pay for the content, I will block ads until they change their business models.”

A concern for publishers is that many people do not realize how much ad-blocking can harm business. While less than 20% of people surf the web on a desktop using ad-blockers (according to PageFair), the benefits and ease of access are much greater on mobile. There is no reliable data yet on how many people are using the new feature, but there is the sense that it will be significantly higher than 20%. Nilay Patel, EIC of The Verge, suggests that as more people start to block advertisements, ad networks will create more intrusive ads to combat the lost revenue, which will cause more people to block ads.

Many publishers are claiming that Apple included this feature to benefit their own platform. Apple News, another new feature on iOS, allows web publishers to include ads with no way for users to stop them (since ad-blocking on works in the browser). Apple also includes a feature to host ads, so they receive a cut of the profits. It is possible that they introduced these two features at the same time in the attempt to convert publishers and readers to their proprietary system. Apple has always liked to control as much of the experience on their devices as possible, however this move could be damaging to the ideals of the open web. (They did not respond to requests for comment.)

The future of online journalism will definitely be impacted by this new feature. For now, users have to decide whether the improved experience is worth the ethical dilemma of hurting publishers. Publishers have to attempt to find new ways to monetize their content. And large tech companies, such as Apple, have to evaluate whether they are hurting the free and open web.
