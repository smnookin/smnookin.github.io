![Advertisement on iPhone](http://i.imgur.com/k2vp1Qp.jpg)
This month, Apple introduced a small change in the iPhone operating system could force publications to change the way they make money. iOS, Apple's mobile operating system, introduced a new feature that allows ad blocking on iPhones. In the past, web publishers have often relied on advertisements for revenue. Though many readers have avoided ads by using ad blockers on computers. Now, for the first time, readers are able to block ads on their phones as well.

Many articles that you read online are paid for by advertising. These ads can come in the form of pop-up ads, side images, sponsored links, and more. Companies pay online publishers to show ads to the readers, which allow articles to be seen for free. This is great for readers who don’t want to see ads, but bad for publishers who want to make money.

Now, iPhone users can download apps that block 3rd party advertisements on any web page. This can create an ethical dilemma for consumers, because by blocking ads, they are preventing publishers from monetizing their product.

One MIT student, Colin McDonnell, gave a justification for the use of ad-blocking. He said that he “…would much rather pay a subscription than have to deal with ads everywhere. Since [publishers] don’t give an option to pay for the content, I will block ads until they change their business models.”

Publishers are concerned that many people do not realize how much ad-blocking can harm business. If everyone used ad-blockers, many publishers would lose their revenue stream and likely go out of business. And ad blockers are on the rise. A new report from Adobe says [$22 billion](http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/2015_report-the_cost_of_ad_blocking.pdf) worth of ads will be blocked in 2015.

While content blocking has been possible on desktops for many years, the introduction of the feature on iPhone poses a bigger problem to publishers because a large portion of people read news on phones, and iPhones account for over 50% of mobile web usage.

Besides the visual distraction, online advertisements cause a number of other problems — especially on mobile devices. Advertisements make articles slower to download, and also take up a large amount of bandwidth — which can be costly to readers. For example — according to the _New York Times_ — articles on _Boston.com_ will [load 3 times faster if ads are blocked](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/technology/personaltech/ad-blockers-mobile-iphone-browsers.html?_r=0). 

Using an ad-blocker on the iPhone is very compelling. It will remove the visual image of the ad. It will make the article you are reading load faster. It will save you money on data costs. It will improve your battery life by decreasing the number of scripts running. And finally, it will prevent ad networks from recording a history of what sites you visit.

Developers have already written dozens of content blocking apps. The justification from many of the developers is that advertisements that track user behavior (without asking) are unethical enough to justify blocking them.

However, it’s unclear that tracking is the biggest issue users have with ad-blockers. In a small polling of MIT students who use ad-blocking, the reason they used blockers was almost always because the visual ads were “annoying” or “frustrating.” Out of 15 students at MIT that said they used ad-blockers, none of them gave the reason that they had concerns about privacy and tracking.

Nilay Patel, EIC of _The Verge_, suggests that as more people start to block advertisements, ad networks will create more intrusive ads to combat the lost revenue, which will cause more people to block ads.

But Patel argues that this new feature on iOS is not about helping the consumer: it’s about helping Apple. Patel says that “the biggest provider of ads on the web is Google”, Apple’s biggest rival. Apple could have included this feature to benefit their own platform.

For example, there are ways for publishers to still show ads on iOS. They can use Apple’s proprietary news app, Apple News. Apple also includes a feature to host ads, so they receive a cut of the profits. It is possible that they introduced these two features at the same time in the attempt to convert publishers and readers to their proprietary system.

Apple has always liked to control as much of the experience on their devices as possible, however this move could be damaging to the ideals of the open web. They did not respond to requests for comment.

Mathew Butterick, an independent web publisher and designer, agrees that ads are far from the best way to monteize online content. Butterick says that he "loathes web ads as much as anyone... [and I'm] grateful for ad-blocking technology". He argues that ads detract from the design of websites as well as disobey the trust of readers' privacy.

He thinks more publishers should switch to a business model like his. He has multiple online books that are free to read, with no ads. To make money, he sells physical copies of the books, asks for donations on his website, and sells custom made fonts.

He warns that the only way readers can block ads and still allow publishers to stay in business is to help fund them in alternative ways. "Vote with your wallet," and pay for content you enjoy, "otherwise you’re a freeloader."

The future of online journalism will definitely be impacted by this new feature. For now, users have to decide whether the improved experience is worth the ethical dilemma of hurting publishers. Publishers have to attempt to find new ways to monetize their content. And large tech companies, such as Apple, have to evaluate whether they are hurting the free and open web.
