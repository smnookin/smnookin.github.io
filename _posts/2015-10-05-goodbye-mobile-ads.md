This month, a small change in the operating system that runs the iPhone sparked an intense debate in the world of technology and journalism. iOS, Apple's mobile operating system, introduced a new feature that allows ad blocking on iPhones. This has started a three way battle: a battle between users and publishers; a battle between ad blocking software and content companies; and a battle between large companies and free and open web.

Every article online that you read for free is paid for by advertisements. These advertisements can come in the form of pop-up ads, side images, sponsored links, among others. There are some paid subscription services, such as the Wall Street Journal — but these are rare, because it makes articles harder to share online.

Recently, however, advertisements have become more and more intrusive. Web trackers now save and collect data about you to target better ads. Lots of people feel as though this is an invasion of privacy — and they want a way to stop it.

It’s quite simple for someone using a desktop computer to prevent these ads. They can quickly install an extension on their web browser that blocks advertisements and prevents tracking your browser history. This has been impossible on to do on iPhones until this month.

A new feature in iOS allows developers to create these same type of ad blockers for iPhones. This is great news for consumers — because advertising on mobile devices leads to a significant decrease in how fast you can browse the web. Data plans are also expensive, and not downloading ads on to your phone can save readers money.

This is bad news for web publishers — since they can not make money from advertisements that don’t appear on articles. While it may seem like this should have been a problem for many years — the vast majority of people consume more content on their phones than their computers. It’s also clear that ad blockers significantly improve the experience on phones, so it is likely that a higher percentage of people will turn to ad blocking on their phones.

Many publishers are claiming that Apple included this feature to benefit their own platform. Apple News, another new feature on iOS, allows web publishers to include ads with no way for users to stop them. Apple also includes a feature to host ads, so they receive a cut of the profits. Nilay Patel, EIC of The Verge, said on a recent podcast interview "large publications like The Verge will survive. But I'm worried about the smaller websites." He thinks that small publications that rely on advertising will not survive if content blocking continues.

Now users have to decide whether the improved experience is worth the ethical delimma of hurting publishers. Publishers have to attempt to find new ways to monetize their content. And large tech companies have to evaluate whether they are hurting the free and open web. 

Apple, Facebook, Marco Arment, John Gruber, The Verge, and others have not returned email requests for interviews. This article will be updated with further information.
