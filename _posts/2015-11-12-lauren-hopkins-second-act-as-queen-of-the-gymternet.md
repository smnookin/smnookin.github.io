title: "Lauren Hopkins’ Second Act, as Queen of the Gymternet"
---

Two months before this year’s Gymnastics World Championships, the online gymnastics community, the “gymternet,” erupted in controversy when two American gymnasts from California, Alain Kwan and Kylie Dickson announced they would be competing for Belarus. The kicker? Neither Kwan nor Dickson had ever set foot in Belarus or had any previous ties to the country, but when the Belarusian Gymnastics Federation’s vice president, a former teammate of their coach, offered them spots on the team, it was a deal they couldn’t pass up. 

In exchange for expedited dual US-Belarusian citizenship and the chance to make their international debut, the two athletes would don Belarusian flag on their leotards and contribute scores that would, if all went as planned, help the country qualify to the 2016 Olympics. In the end, Kwan and Dickson finished 73rd, and 75th overall, and the Belarusian team did not qualify. 

The online community’s reactions ranged from outraged incredulity to criticisms of American exceptionalism. Among these voices was Lauren Hopkins, Editor in Chief and founder of the site, The Gymter.net, who wrote an impassioned response, “Why I’m angry about Belarus.” Several mainstream news outlets, including AP and the Wall Street Journal also covered the story, but only Hopkins followed up two days later with, “Meet the Belarusian Gymnasts,” an 1100 word profile of the entire Belarusian team, including the two athletes displaced by the Americans. A week later, Hopkins published an explainer detailing the intricate rules that govern how countries and individuals qualify to the 2016 Olympic Games from the World Championships. 

[TK: Quote by Lauren - need to ask her about how she handled this situation]

This type of detailed, insider coverage is typical for Hopkin’s site, which bills itself as the “ultimate gym site, for the ultimate gym nerd.” Content spans the globe - in a typical year, Hopkins will cover everything from the American Cup to Chinese Nationals and Australian Championships. In a world where NBC broadcasts just 3-5 gymnastics meets annually, this year, Hopkins and her team covered nearly 90 gymnastics competitions, most of which would be of little interest to the average American viewer who might prefer baseball or football. 

On the Internet, however, fandom knows no bounds. Between Twitter, Tumblr, and the blogosphere, the Internet has allowed gym fans from all over the world to unite as the gymternet, who now enjoy an unprecedented level of access into the goings-on of the international gymnastics circuit. Obsessives pore over and dissect gymnasts routines, making gifs and [some other behavior]. Hopkin’s site is poised perfectly to capture this readership. 

Hopkins started the Gymter.net in 2014 [TK month], after four years of writing for other gymnastics publications. She spends 25-40 hours a week on the hybrid news and fan site, where she writes with both the factual, objective voice associated with mainstream news outlets and the conversational, enthusiastic [TK word] of an obsessed gymnastics fan. She’s may be self professed “stan,” gymternet lingo for “stalker fan,” of Brenna Dowell, a member of the US national team, but admits she is “realistic” about her shot at making the 2016 Olympic team. 
[but readily points out her falls in competition recaps]. 

One of Hopkin’s biggest challenges is figuring out the right tone to strike. Female gymnasts are young and can start competing as early as age 7, with many peaking between 14-18. The minimum age to participate in the Olympics is 16. They may be on national television before they’ve graduated high school. When they fall, millions of viewers gasp, and hours later, gifs will be shared and replayed on the Internet. The gymternet can often be harsh, holding middle-school aged gymnasts to scrutiny most teenagers will never experience. 

“It’s hard because you want to be realistic, when they’re young. I think to myself, if this was another sport, like football, we would be pointing out a person’s flaws, but there’s a way to do that by being honest and not sugarcoating it, as opposed to be cruel.”

Hopkins recounts her first ever article on gymnastics in 2011, where she learned this lesson the hard way. “I went to the Woga Classic [TK describe] and tried to be snarky and funny, and it came off as super mean. So now, instead of saying ‘she’s terrible and won’t go anywhere,’ I’ll find something about her I liked to say. Even if I don’t think she’s going to the Olympics, I’ll point out I’m looking forward to seeing where she goes in the future.”

Hopkins, who is 27, grew up in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, a sleepy [TK might change to suburban] coastal town an hour south of Boston. Though she dabbled in recreational gymnastics, her passion was musical theater. 

“My goal  was to be on Broadway. I’d go to school, go to theater practice, stay there until 10-11pm, go home and go to bed. My mom loved it,” she laughs, “because it didn’t leave a lot of time to get into trouble - meanwhile, all my friends were sneaking out of the house and going to parties.”

Hopkins got her first paid acting gig at 15, and at 17, left her hometown for New York City, eschewing college for her Broadway dreams. It was a hard decision for her parents to swallow. But for Hopkins, the doubts only fueled her desire.

“They definitely didn’t want me to do theater. When I left, they said, ‘you’ll be back in a year! You’ll cave and come back.’ You’ll never go to college, you’ll be stuck working, they said. They kept threatening I’d be working at McDonald’s for the rest of my life. I really wanted to prove them wrong.”

She admits the six years she spent pursuing acting was tough, but notes with a gleam of triumph that she did not go “crawling back.” Instead, she filled her days with auditions and her nights with side gigs, picking up jobs as a waitress or an usherer. 

“Auditions are terrible. You wake up at 5am, there’s anywhere between 100-500 people, and you wait in line all day. And there’s this thing called ‘typing,” where they bring you in groups of 40 and say, ‘you stay, you stay, everyone else leave,’ because you’re not what they want physically. Then, you go to your side job, you don’t get home until midnight, and then you have to be up at 5am again.”

Hopkins found various roles in New England regional theater productions, which cast actors from New York for lead parts and local actors for the ensemble parts. She starred in Orphan Annie, Little House on the Prairie, and Grease, often on the road for months at a time. Money was always an issue.

“I lived in seven apartments in two years...you make ends meet, in that you can pay your rent and make dinner, but nothing else. I had exactly $200 left at the end of the month, so I never had a steady source of income. It’s like, I was 23, and I wanted to do was buy a couch or something! Even for something like going to the Gap and buying a pair of jeans, I had to think about it.”

During her six years as an actor, Hopkins began laying the foundation for her second act as a sports journalist, even though she didn’t know it at the time. In 2008, she re-kindled her interest in gymnastics during the Beijing Olympics, and by 2009, she had dedicated herself to learning the Code of Points, the daunting 200 page document that governs the point value of every skill a gymnast can perform. Most lay people can describe twisting, or flipping in vague terms, but Hopkins can tell you from memory that the start value of a [TK gymnastics skill] is [TK number]. 

In 2010, Hopkins shelved her acting career and enrolled in Columbia University, wanting a “regular life, regular apartment, and a regular job.” During college, she began writing for the Couch Gymnast and was their U.S. editor by 2012. After graduating, Hopkins started the Gymter.net, looking for an outlet to write about gymnastics “on [her] own terms.”

For 3 months, the site had no ads, and Hopkins self financed all travel expenses. Last year, she covered US Nationals in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, eschewing a $200 flight for an 8 hour $40 bus ride. 

During this time, Hopkins was also contemplating applying to law school and worked as a paralegal to test out the waters.

“I absolutely hated it. I was working in litigation and watching our lawyers work from 6am to midnight. They were always going on dinners and golf trips,” she laughs. “That seemed like the absolute worst thing to me, networking for life. It’s all business people, doing business all the time. Even when I really hated going to the office, I kept telling myself, you’re making money to finance [travel to] Worlds.”

WIth law school off the table, Hopkins switched day jobs and doubled down on the site. Though the site isn’t financially secure enough to pay a salary, money from ads and donations do pay for travel expenses. Hopkins now does digital media for a New York City law firm (“It pays really well”), where she says she is much happier. 

Hopkins seems imbued with superhuman time management skills, between her full time day job and spending 25-40 hours a week on her website. On top of that, she is also writing a book, a YA novel about a gymnast vying for a spot on the 2016 US Olympic team. Her friend Jennifer Iacopelli, who is also a novelist tells me the secret to making it work. 

“She doesn't sleep. I'm convinced she doesn't sleep! And if she does, it’s just in bursts. She sleeps from Friday midnight to Saturday noon, and that will sustain her for 4-5 days. She's an amazing hard worker,” she says. 

Hopkins laughs but admits balancing all her commitments can be tough. 

“My day job always has to come first, otherwise the site wouldn’t be able to exist. I never say, ‘I’m going to leave work for five hours to watch gymnastics,’ although -” she lowers her voice, “I did go to the firm’s library and watch the women’s all around final in the middle of the day,” she laughs conspiratorially. 

“But I think my coworkers know that what you do is a hobby, just like what normal people do in their spare time. They go golfing, I do gymnastics.”


Planned for final draft:
More about the book and her future
Interview with a media studies person who can contextualize her site
Interview with owner of competitor site
Ideally meeting her in person to hover and watch her work
How she deals with trolls/haters - her tumblr was taken offline while during the writing of this profile
How she deals with sensitive issues like racism in the Gymternet
