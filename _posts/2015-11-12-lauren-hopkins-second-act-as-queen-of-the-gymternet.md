title: "Lauren Hopkins’ Second Act, as Queen of the Gymternet"
---

Three weeks before this year’s World Artistic Gymnastics Championships (held October 23 - November 1) the online gymnastics community, a.k.a. the gymternet, erupted in controversy when two American gymnasts from California, Alain Kwan and Kylie Dickson, announced they would be competing for Belarus. The kicker? Neither Kwan nor Dickson had ever set foot in Belarus or had any previous ties to the country. In exchange for expedited dual US-Belarusian citizenship and the chance to make their international debut, the two athletes were supposed to help Belarus secure a spot at the 2016 Olympics test event. 

The backlash was such a big deal that it was covered in mainstream news outlets like the [AP](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/3567690e44a847aea3d3df3282e345de/american-gymnasts-create-unlikely-alliance-belarus) and the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-women-gymnasts-qualify-for-rio-olympics-though-in-mixed-fashion-1445729014) three weeks later during the competition. But in the meantime, for die-hard gym fans interested in more than a quick-gloss on the controversy, there was only one place to go: Lauren Hopkin’s [thegymter.net](http://thegymter.net/), the eight person, volunteer news and fansite she founded in July of 2014. 

Hopkins did not disappoint. She wrote an impassioned response, [“Why I’m angry about Belarus](http://thegymter.net/2015/10/01/why-im-angry-about-belarus/),” which got 15,000 pageviews, the second most popular article in the site’s history. 

“When I first heard the news, I was wondering, ‘Should I just report what happened?’ No, that's what everyone else will do. I like writing when I have a strong opinion, so I decided to write something that had the potential to be ‘inflammatory,'" she said.

Former Belarusian gymnasts, including Svetlana Boginskaya, 3x Olympic champion who competed for the Soviet Union in the late 1980s to 1990s commented on her essay. Even the president of the Cayman Islands Gymnastics Association reached out - she emailed Hopkins to say her organization would never do what Belarus did.

Two days later, Hopkins followed up with, [“Meet the Belarusian Gymnasts,”](http://thegymter.net/2015/10/03/meet-the-belarusian-gymnasts/) an 1100 word profile of the entire Belarusian team, including the two athletes displaced by the Americans. A week later, Hopkins published an [explainer](http://thegymter.net/2015/10/16/how-these-world-championships-work/) detailing the intricate rules that govern how countries and individuals qualify to the 2016 Olympic Games from the World Championships. 

This type of detailed, insider coverage is typical for Hopkins' site, which bills itself as the “ultimate gym site, for the ultimate gym nerd.” The site averages 300,000-400,000 pageviews a month, going up to half a million during major competitions. 

Content spans the globe - in a typical year, Hopkins and her team of seven volunteers will cover everything from the American Cup to Chinese Nationals and Australian Championships. In a world where NBC broadcasts just 3-5 gymnastics meets annually, this year, Hopkins and her team covered nearly 90 gymnastics competitions, most of which would be of little interest to the average American viewer who might prefer baseball or football. 

But the Internet has allowed fans from all around the world to form online communities, where obsessives endlessly dissect routines and write mini-novels about their favorite athletes. Gymnastics is no exception, and Hopkins’ site is poised perfectly to capture this readership.

During college, Hopkins spent four years as a writer and editor for the website Couch Gymnast, receiving ⅓ of the monthly ad revenue as payment. When the site crashed for two months in 2014, Hopkins, wanting an outlet to write, decided to strike out on her own. She launched [thegymter.net](http://thegymter.net/) last July. 

She spends 25-40 hours a week on the hybrid news and fan site, where she writes with both the factual, objective voice associated with mainstream news outlets and the conversational enthusiasm of an obsessed gymnastics fan. She may be self-professed “stan,” internet lingo for “stalker fan,” of Brenna Dowell, a member of the US national team, but admits she is “realistic” about Dowell's shot at the 2016 Olympic team. 

One of Hopkin’s early challenges was figuring out the right tone to strike. Female gymnasts can start competing as early as age 5, and many peak between 14-18. Gabby Douglas, for example was 16 when she won the 2012 Olympic All-Around medal and Nastia Liukin was 18 when she won in 2008.

The best gymnasts are featured on national television before they’ve graduated high school. When they fall, millions of viewers are watching – and, in some cases, mocking and teasing as well. The gymternet can be harsh, holding teenagers to a level of scrutiny most adults will never experience. 

“It’s hard because you want to be realistic, when they’re young,” Hopkins says. “I think to myself, if this was another sport, like football, we would be pointing out a person’s flaws, but there’s a way to do that by being honest and not sugarcoating it, as opposed to be cruel.”

Hopkins recounts an early article she wrote for the [Couch Gymnast](http://www.thecouchgymnast.com/) in 2011, where she learned this lesson the hard way. In her coverage of a small meet in Texas, Hopkins wrote that one of the gymnasts was wearing a heavy knee brace and “looked like she was about to cry.” The gymnast’s coach took offense and emailed her editor. 

“It came off as I was accusing the coach of not paying attention to [the gymnast’s] injury, that I was saying, ‘get this girl off the gym floor!’, when I didn’t mean that at all,” said Hopkins. She amended the article, and now she tries to strike a positive but fair tone. 

“When I have a criticism or an observation, I’ll find something about her I liked to say. Even if I don’t think someone is going to the Olympics, I’ll point out I’m looking forward to seeing where she goes in the future,” she says.

***

Hopkins, who is 27, grew up in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, a suburban coastal town an hour south of Boston. Though she dabbled in recreational gymnastics, her passion was musical theater. 

“My goal  was to be on Broadway. I’d go to school, go to theater practice, stay there until 10-11pm, go home and go to bed. My mom loved it,” she laughs, “because it didn’t leave a lot of time to get into trouble - meanwhile, all my friends were sneaking out of the house and going to parties.”

Hopkins got her first paid acting gig at 15, and at 17, left her hometown for New York City, eschewing college for her Broadway dreams. It was a hard decision for her parents to swallow. But for Hopkins, the doubts only fueled her desire.

“They definitely didn’t want me to do theater. When I left, they said, ‘you’ll be back in a year! You’ll cave and come back.’ You’ll never go to college, you’ll be stuck working, they said. They kept threatening I’d be working at McDonald’s for the rest of my life. I really wanted to prove them wrong,” she said.

The six years she spent pursuing acting was tough, she admits, but she did not go “crawling back.” Instead, she filled her days with auditions and her nights with side gigs, picking up jobs as a waitress or an usherer. 

“Auditions are terrible. You wake up at 5am, there’s anywhere between 100-500 people, and you wait in line all day. And there’s this thing called ‘typing,” where they bring you in groups of 40 and say, ‘you stay, you stay, everyone else leave,’ because you’re not what they want physically. Then, you go to your side job, you don’t get home until midnight, and then you have to be up at 5am again.”

Hopkins found various roles in New England regional theater productions, which cast actors from New York for lead parts and local actors for the ensemble parts. She starred in Orphan Annie, Little House on the Prairie, and Grease, often on the road for months at a time. Money was always an issue.

“I lived in seven apartments in two years...you make ends meet, in that you can pay your rent and make dinner, but nothing else. I had exactly $200 left at the end of the month, so I never had a steady source of income. It’s like, I was 23, and I wanted to do was buy a couch or something! Even for something like going to the Gap and buying a pair of jeans, I had to think about it.”

During her six years as an actor, Hopkins began laying the foundation for her second act as a sports journalist, though she didn’t know it at the time. In 2008, she re-kindled her interest in gymnastics during the Beijing Olympics. By 2009, she had dedicated herself to learning the [Code of Points](http://www.fig-docs.com/Media/Codes%20of%20Points%202013%20-%202016/WAG/2013-2016%20WAG%20CoP.pdf), the daunting 200 page document that governs the point value of every skill a gymnast can perform. Most lay people can describe twisting, or flipping in vague terms, but Hopkins can tell you from memory that the start value of a [double layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK1pEQj6qnY) on floor exercise is 0.6.

In 2010, Hopkins shelved her acting career and enrolled in Columbia University. She majored in history and wanted a “regular life, regular apartment, and a regular job.” During college, she began writing for the Couch Gymnast and was promoted to U.S. editor in 2012. True to her multi-tasking nature, she also picked up a 20/hour week job freshman year as an admin for a physical therapy practice, a job she held for 3.5 years. 

“School always came first, and I was usually pretty good at saying when I was too busy to write. The only time it came up was during the 2012 Olympics, when I was taking this four hours a day, four person summer class on US-foreign relations pre and post war. I went for two days, and was like, ‘Hmm, do I want to stay at home and cover the Olympics all day, or do I want to go to this class?’” she laughs.

She dropped the class and chose the Olympics. Two years later, [thegymter.net](http://thegymter.net/) was born.

For three months, the site had no ads, and Hopkins self financed all travel expenses. Last year, she covered US Nationals in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, eschewing a $200 flight for an 8 hour $40 bus ride from New York City. 

During this time, Hopkins also contemplated law school and worked as a paralegal to test out the waters.

“I absolutely hated it. I was working in litigation and watching our lawyers work from 6am to midnight. They were always going on dinners and golf trips,” she laughs. “That seemed like the absolute worst thing to me, networking for life. It’s all business people, doing business all the time. Even when I really hated going to the office, I kept telling myself, you’re making money to finance [travel to] Worlds.”

WIth law school off the table, Hopkins switched day jobs and doubled down on the site. Though the site isn’t financially secure enough to pay a salary, money from ads and the occasional donation pay for travel expenses. Hopkins now does digital media for a New York City law firm (“It pays really well”), where she is much happier. In August, she also picked up a part time Public Relations gig for [Texas Dream Gymnastics](http://texasdreams.com/), a well-known gymnastics training ground for Olympic hopefuls.

Recently, though, Hopkins has faced the ugly side of the gymternet. Two weeks ago, her Tumblr account, where she answers dozens of gymnastics questions daily, was hacked. The intruder deleted her posts, one by one. All 10,000+ entries are gone. One insouciant word remains: “Well.” Another person, or possibly the same one, impersonated her on Twitter and sent her daily, racist tweets about a prominent gymnast. Hopkins managed to get Twitter to shut it down. Another Twitter account popped up to accuse Hopkins of bullying teenagers.

“I’ve had crazy anons before, but no one has ever gone to this extreme of trying to destroy my online presence,” she says.

Hopkins stays upbeat. “The haters used to really bother me in the beginning, because I was taking it personally, but now, I think of it as the people who are doing it clearly have nothing going on with their lives, if they’re messaging me 10 times a day or constantly tweeting at me,” she laughs. 

She adds, “I was spending so much time on Tumblr, so it was almost a blessing in disguise.”

On top of her day job, part time job, and website, Hopkins also recently completed her first book, [_Finding Our Balance_](http://laurenhopkinsbooks.com/), a YA novel about a gymnast vying for a spot on the 2016 Olympic team. Hopkins' goal for the book is to accurately capture what it’s like to be an elite gymnast today, eschewing needless “melodrama” for gymnastics verisimilitude. The choice to put gymnastics in the foreground turned off agents, and Hopkins chose to self publish. 

“I had 3 agents that were interested, and none said they would be able to sell it with sports as the main focus. They all wanted to change the story so that gymnastics was secondary. One of the editors even said, ‘there needs to be boy drama, there needs to be boy drama’ but I’m like, you don’t understand! These are 15 year old girls trying to make the Olympics, and you think they have boyfriends?” she says, stressing the last word incredulously. 

The book comes out in December and Hopkins plans to write two more to complete a trilogy. 

Her friend Jennifer Iacopelli, who is also a novelist, tells me the secret to making it work. 

“She doesn't sleep. I'm convinced she doesn't sleep! And if she does, it’s just in bursts. She sleeps from Friday midnight to Saturday noon, and that will sustain her for 4-5 days. She's an amazing hard worker,” she says. 

Hopkins laughs but admits balancing all her commitments can be tough. 

“My day job always has to come first, otherwise the gymnastics stuff wouldn’t be able to exist. I never say, ‘I’m going to leave work for five hours to watch gymnastics,’ although -” she lowers her voice, “I did go to the firm’s library and watch the women’s all around final in the middle of the day,” she laughs conspiratorially. 

“But I think my coworkers know that what you do is a hobby, just like what normal people do in their spare time. They go golfing, I do gymnastics," she says.
