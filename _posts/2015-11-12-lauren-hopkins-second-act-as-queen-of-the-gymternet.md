title: "Lauren Hopkins’ Second Act, as Queen of the Gymternet"
---

Three weeks before this year’s World Artistic Gymnastics Championships (held October 23 - November 1) the online gymnastics community, a.k.a. the gymternet, erupted in controversy when two American gymnasts from California, Alain Kwan and Kylie Dickson, announced they would be competing for Belarus. The kicker? Neither Kwan nor Dickson had ever set foot in Belarus or had any previous ties to the country. In exchange for expedited dual US-Belarusian citizenship and the chance to make their international debut, the two athletes were supposed to help Belarus secure a spot at the 2016 Olympics test event. 

The backlash was such a big deal that it was covered in mainstream news outlets like the AP and the Wall Street Journal. But for die-hard gym fans interested in more than a quick-gloss on the controversy, there was only one place to go: Lauren Hopkin’s thegymter.net, the eight person, volunteer news and fan-site she founded in July of 2014. 

Hopkins did not disappoint. She wrote an impassioned response, “Why I’m angry about Belarus,” which got 15,000 pageviews, the second most popular article in the site’s history. Former Belarusian gymnasts, including Svetlana Boginskaya, 3x Olympic champion who competed for the Soviet Union in the late 1980’s to 1990’s [TK action]. Even the president of the Cayman Islands Gymnastics Association reached out - she emailed Hopkins to say her organization would never do what Belarus did.

Two days later, she followed up with, “Meet the Belarusian Gymnasts,” an 1100 word profile of the entire Belarusian team, including the two athletes displaced by the Americans. A week later, Hopkins published an explainer detailing the intricate rules that govern how countries and individuals qualify to the 2016 Olympic Games from the World Championships. 

This type of detailed, insider coverage is typical for Hopkin’s site, which bills itself as the “ultimate gym site, for the ultimate gym nerd.” The site averages 300,000-400,000 pageviews a month, going up to half a million during major competitions. 

Content spans the globe - in a typical year, Hopkins and her team of seven volunteers will cover everything from the American Cup to Chinese Nationals and Australian Championships. In a world where NBC broadcasts just 3-5 gymnastics meets annually, this year, Hopkins and her team covered nearly 90 gymnastics competitions, most of which would be of little interest to the average American viewer who might prefer baseball or football. 

But the Internet as allowed fans from all around the world to form online communities, where obsessives endlessly dissect routines and write treatises about their favorite athletes. Gymnastics is no exception, and Hopkins’ site is poised perfectly to capture this readership.

During college, Hopkins spent four years as a writer and editor for the website Couch Gymnast, receiving ⅓ of the monthly ad revenue as payment. When the site crashed for two months in 2014, Hopkins, wanting an outlet to write, decided to strike out on her own, launching thegymter.net in last July. 

She spends 25-40 hours a week on the hybrid news and fan site, where she writes with both the factual, objective voice associated with mainstream news outlets and the conversational enthusiasm of an obsessed gymnastics fan. She may be self-professed “stan,” internet lingo for “stalker fan,” of Brenna Dowell, a member of the US national team, but admits she is “realistic” about her shot at making the 2016 Olympic team. 

One of Hopkin’s early challenges was figuring out the right tone to strike. Female gymnasts can start competing as early as age 7, and many peak between 14-18. Gabby Douglas, for example was 16 when she won the 2012 Olympic All-Around medal, and Nastia Liukin was 18 when she won in 2008.

The best gymnasts are featured on national television before they’ve graduated high school. When they fall, millions of viewers are watching – and, in some cases, mocking and teasing as well. The gymternet can be harsh, holding teenagers to a level of scrutiny most adults will never experience. 

“It’s hard because you want to be realistic, when they’re young,” Hopkins says. “I think to myself, if this was another sport, like football, we would be pointing out a person’s flaws, but there’s a way to do that by being honest and not sugarcoating it, as opposed to be cruel.”

Hopkins recounts an early article she wrote for the Couch Gymnast 2011, where she learned this lesson the hard way. In her coverage of a small meet in Texas, Hopkins wrote that one of the gymnasts was wearing a heavy knee brace and “looked like she was about to cry.” The gymnast’s coach took offense and emailed her editor. 

“The way it came off was that I was accusing the coach of not paying attention to [the gymnast’s] injury, that I was saying, ‘get this girl off the gym floor!’, when I didn’t mean that at all,” said Hopkins. Afterward, Hopkins amended the article, and now, she says, she tries to strike a positive, but fair tone. 

“When I have a criticism or an observation, I’ll find something about her I liked to say. Even if I don’t think someone is going to the Olympics, I’ll point out I’m looking forward to seeing where she goes in the future,” she says.

Hopkins, who is 27, grew up in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, a suburban coastal town an hour south of Boston. Though she dabbled in recreational gymnastics, her passion was musical theater. 

“My goal  was to be on Broadway. I’d go to school, go to theater practice, stay there until 10-11pm, go home and go to bed. My mom loved it,” she laughs, “because it didn’t leave a lot of time to get into trouble - meanwhile, all my friends were sneaking out of the house and going to parties.”

Hopkins got her first paid acting gig at 15, and at 17, left her hometown for New York City, eschewing college for her Broadway dreams. It was a hard decision for her parents to swallow. But for Hopkins, the doubts only fueled her desire.

“They definitely didn’t want me to do theater. When I left, they said, ‘you’ll be back in a year! You’ll cave and come back.’ You’ll never go to college, you’ll be stuck working, they said. They kept threatening I’d be working at McDonald’s for the rest of my life. I really wanted to prove them wrong.”

She admits the six years she spent pursuing acting was tough, but notes with a gleam of triumph that she did not go “crawling back.” Instead, she filled her days with auditions and her nights with side gigs, picking up jobs as a waitress or an usherer. 

“Auditions are terrible. You wake up at 5am, there’s anywhere between 100-500 people, and you wait in line all day. And there’s this thing called ‘typing,” where they bring you in groups of 40 and say, ‘you stay, you stay, everyone else leave,’ because you’re not what they want physically. Then, you go to your side job, you don’t get home until midnight, and then you have to be up at 5am again.”

Hopkins found various roles in New England regional theater productions, which cast actors from New York for lead parts and local actors for the ensemble parts. She starred in Orphan Annie, Little House on the Prairie, and Grease, often on the road for months at a time. Money was always an issue.

“I lived in seven apartments in two years...you make ends meet, in that you can pay your rent and make dinner, but nothing else. I had exactly $200 left at the end of the month, so I never had a steady source of income. It’s like, I was 23, and I wanted to do was buy a couch or something! Even for something like going to the Gap and buying a pair of jeans, I had to think about it.”

During her six years as an actor, Hopkins began laying the foundation for her second act as a sports journalist, even though she didn’t know it at the time. In 2008, she re-kindled her interest in gymnastics during the Beijing Olympics, and by 2009, she had dedicated herself to learning the Code of Points, the daunting 200 page document that governs the point value of every skill a gymnast can perform. Most lay people can describe twisting, or flipping in vague terms, but Hopkins can tell you from memory that the start value of a [TK gymnastics skill] is [TK number]. 

In 2010, Hopkins shelved her acting career and enrolled in Columbia University, wanting a “regular life, regular apartment, and a regular job.” During college, she began writing for the Couch Gymnast and was their U.S. editor by 2012. After graduating, Hopkins started the Gymter.net, looking for an outlet to write about gymnastics “on [her] own terms.”

For 3 months, the site had no ads, and Hopkins self financed all travel expenses. Last year, she covered US Nationals in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, eschewing a $200 flight for an 8 hour $40 bus ride. 

During this time, Hopkins was also contemplating applying to law school and worked as a paralegal to test out the waters.

“I absolutely hated it. I was working in litigation and watching our lawyers work from 6am to midnight. They were always going on dinners and golf trips,” she laughs. “That seemed like the absolute worst thing to me, networking for life. It’s all business people, doing business all the time. Even when I really hated going to the office, I kept telling myself, you’re making money to finance [travel to] Worlds.”

WIth law school off the table, Hopkins switched day jobs and doubled down on the site. Though the site isn’t financially secure enough to pay a salary, money from ads and donations do pay for travel expenses. Hopkins now does digital media for a New York City law firm (“It pays really well”), where she says she is much happier. 

Hopkins seems imbued with superhuman time management skills, between her full time day job and spending 25-40 hours a week on her website. On top of that, she is also writing a book, a YA novel about a gymnast vying for a spot on the 2016 US Olympic team. Her friend Jennifer Iacopelli, who is also a novelist tells me the secret to making it work. 

“She doesn't sleep. I'm convinced she doesn't sleep! And if she does, it’s just in bursts. She sleeps from Friday midnight to Saturday noon, and that will sustain her for 4-5 days. She's an amazing hard worker,” she says. 

Hopkins laughs but admits balancing all her commitments can be tough. 

“My day job always has to come first, otherwise the site wouldn’t be able to exist. I never say, ‘I’m going to leave work for five hours to watch gymnastics,’ although -” she lowers her voice, “I did go to the firm’s library and watch the women’s all around final in the middle of the day,” she laughs conspiratorially. 

“But I think my coworkers know that what you do is a hobby, just like what normal people do in their spare time. They go golfing, I do gymnastics.”
