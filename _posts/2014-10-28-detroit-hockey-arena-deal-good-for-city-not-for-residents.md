![joe.jpg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Joe_Louis_Arena.JPG/800px-Joe_Louis_Arena.JPG)    “Hey, hey, Hockeytown!” This phrase alone is enough to catapult me back to my childhood in the late nineties. In the year 1998, I was six years old and living in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. I was just old enough to understand that the Red Wings, Detroit’s hockey team, had just won the National Hockey League’s Stanley Cup for the second time in a row, catapulting the city into the national spotlight and giving fans a reason to [throw octopi](http://redwings.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=43781 ) on the ice of the arena. 

Recently, _The New York Times_ published a [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/business/detroit­reaches­settlement­with­re maining­big­creditor.html ) detailing the plans for the demolition of the home of the Detroit Red Wings, the Joe Louis Arena (or just “the Joe,” in local parlance). The City of Detroit reached a settlement with one of its creditors, The Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, which plans to construct an amalgam of hotel rooms, retail developments, and condominiums in place of the arena. 

The Joe will be replaced by a new, bowl-shaped stadium near Comerica Park, where the Tigers play baseball, and Ford Field, where the Lions play football. Currently, the stadium’s new location is an empty dirt lot, a familiar sight in the city. Since the 1960’s, Detroit has tumbled through post-industrialism, racism (and its accompanying ‘white flight’ to the suburbs), poverty (and its accompanying drug and violence issues and empty lots), and, most recently, bankruptcy. 

There is a lot of talk about the city of Detroit’s “revitalization” efforts. This buzzword is often confusing, as it encompasses many projects, both grassroots and from the top down -- both working within the system and working against it. On the one hand, many residents of Detroit see the destruction wrought by de-industrialization as an example of “how giants fall,” and an opportunity to [create something different](http://www.pbs.org/pov/americanrevolutionary/ ). They are starting schools, planning community gardens, and hosting block parties to connect with neighbors. On the other hand, many others see economic growth as the key to solving many of Detroit’s problems. They are working on bringing businesses into the city, encouraging an influx of the creative class, and [celebrating the arrival of Whole Foods to Midtown](http://www.vice.com/read/detroit­is­already­starting­to­gentrify ), a borough of Detroit. 

If this latter narrative doesn’t sound familiar to you, it should. This is a common story of gentrification, seen already in The Mission District in San Francisco, for example. Young white people-- the creative class-- move in, bring along their cafes and yoga studios, and, before you know it, long-time residents can’t afford to live there anymore. 

This is what worries me about the planned demolition and rebuilding of Detroit’s hockey arena. The planned new location is in a quickly-gentrifying hub of the city, “Wildcat Corner”, a place that already is heavily policed and regularly attracts white folks from the suburbs. In the place of the Joe Louis Arena, they will build a hotel, condos, and retail spaces-- for use by those who can afford them.  

This trend of heavier policing and higher-end economic development to revitalize the city will not help current residents; in fact, it will most likely hurt them, pushing them out of their homes as housing prices rise. Don’t get me wrong-- I am not arguing that the Joe Louis Arena, despite my sentimental attachments, should be saved from demolition, or that doing so will help current residents of Detroit. Putting the settlement into a larger context, however, it is clear that the move will contribute to a wider phenomenon-- gentrification-- that will harm the city’s poorer residents.
