Elevators have been making the news a lot this year. In May, a video showed Beyoncé’s sister Solange Knowles attacking her brother-in-law, Jay-Z, in a New York City hotel elevator. Then, in September, a video revealed Superbowl-winning running back Ray Rice beating his now-wife, Janay, unconscious in an Atlantic City casino elevator. Though the swanky elevators and the domestic violence they contained are similar, the world’s reactions to the two incidents couldn’t be more different. 

While a deafening public outcry led to the NFL’s indefinite suspension of Rice and the rippling penalization of other players, Solange became the newest punch line for comedians. [Saturday Night Live](http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/watch-saturday-night-love-jay-z-solange-knowles-spoof-1201185453/) opened their season finale with a skit unveiling the video’s “missing” audio. It turns out Solange was just trying to kill a spider crawling on Jay-Z! Whew, what a relief.

In comparison to Rice's life-threatening assault, it might seem comical when a slender 5'8" woman tries to kick a 6'2" man who calls himself the [best rapper alive](http://rap.genius.com/Jay-z-best-rapper-alive-lyrics). It's true that women experience [more severe violence](http://dahmw.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/Common-Myths-about-Intimate-Partner-Violence-against-Men2012.pdf) than men and constitute the majority of homicide cases. 

Sure, Solange's attack seemed harmless. But by brushing off and mocking minor assaults, we become desensitized to the general idea of a female batterer. Ask anyone to define domestic violence, and they’ll likely describe a controlling man battering a hopeless woman. Yet over four decades of research show that women and men report performing acts of domestic violence against at [nearly equal rates](http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/intimate-partner-violence/Pages/measuring.aspx). Nevertheless, _victims_ are [overwhelmingly female](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf). So, that's confusing. Since domestic violence most commonly occurs between opposite-sex partners, shouldn't most perpetrators be men? The numbers can get pretty messy since they're based on legal data, self-reports, or both.

While both genders grossly underreport domestic violence, male victims are especially unlikely to report cases because they [fear they won’t be believed](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/12/domestic-violence-male-victims-embarrassment). Injuries edured by men may not require emergency room attention or may not be physical at all. Domestic abuse encompasses both emotional and psychological abuse as well.

Centuries-old gender stereotypes tell us that men are strong and controlling, not abused victims who need help. Does this still hold today? If the assaults by Rice and Knowles had been more comprable, would our reactions have been the same? Actors from the improv group OckTV staged a [social experiment](http://www.today.com/news/domestic-violence-social-experiment-what-would-you-do-2D80191075) to find out. A woman assaulted a man in one scenario and a man attacked a woman in the other. While people intervened to pull the man off the woman, they laughed, recorded and even helped the woman beating her boyfriend.

[Friends and bystanders are a key resource](http://cms350.com/politics/keeping-an-arm-s-length-colleges-not-doing-much-to-address-dating-violence.html) in identifying and preventing domestic violence—a challenging task given the wide range of severity. But when people laugh at a dramatically obvious case of woman-on-man violence, how can we expect them to help fix this problem?

The media microscope on the NFL has not only forced the league to upend their typical response to domestic violence, but has provoked the public to do the same. Now, it’s not just about professional football players—or men.[_The Washington Post_’s Cindy Boren](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/09/19/hope-solo-and-the-domestic-violence-case-no-one-is-talking-about/) criticized U.S. Soccer for allowing Hope Solo to continue playing despite being charged with punching her nephew and breaking a broom over her half-sister’s head last June. 

“While U.S. Soccer doesn’t have the same high profile as the NFL, how do the cases differ? Aren’t women’s soccer players just as much role models as male football players?” she writes. “Why is the notion of awaiting due process so inconsistently applied?” 

In a biting response, [_Slate_’s Amanda Hess](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/09/hope_solo_domestic_violence_it_is_very_very_stupid_to_compare_the_soccer.html) argues that while Boren’s calls for equal punishments are “worthy,” they’re unnecessary—U.S. Soccer would just be wasting their time trying to raise awareness of the problem. "But whether or not it’s the right call to suspend Hope Solo, how necessary is it for an institution like U.S. women’s soccer to send a message to young girls that it’s not OK to violently attack their family members?" she writes.

Hess also claims that the "perpetrators of domestic violence are overwhelmingly male, the victims are overwhelmingly female, and the violence that occurs between intimate partners represents a far more insidious form of abuse than that of a woman fighting with her extended family.” It’s not clear how she draws this false conclusion, given that the [data she sites](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ipvus.pdf) doesn’t include any perpetration rates by gender. 

She does get one thing right: her headline “No, Women’s Soccer Does Not Have A Domestic Violence Problem.” Of course women’s soccer doesn’t have a domestic violence problem, and neither does the NFL. And men aren't the only one with the problem. Domestic violence is everyone’s problem—-one that costs the world [$8 trillion every month](http://freakonomics.com/2014/10/02/108967/). It’s a crime no matter who commits it. After [years of turning a blind eye](http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/11553070/why-hope-solo-suspended-team-usa-immediately), the NFL has set a new precedent for punishing prominent figures charged with domestic violence. Other employers of public figures should be expected to do the do the same. 

By ignoring Hope Solo’s attacks in lieu of [“an opportunity to set a significant record,”](http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/11553070/why-hope-solo-suspended-team-usa-immediately) U.S. Soccer is virtually saying that female athletes charged with domestic violence deserve some slack, because they aren't really role models anyways. 

Because our perceptions of violence are gendered, the consequences of that violence are too. Until men feel comfortable coming forward about their victimization, female perpetrators of domestic violence will be forgiven and forgotten. The feminist movement empowered women to speak out about domestic violence, but inadvertently deepened the chasm of inequality for male victims. And men aren't the only ones scarred. Countless studies have shown that children raised in a home of domestic violence are likely to continue the cycle of abuse. Now it’s time for a new feminism that treats violence as violence, without caveats or excuses based on sex.
