Elevators have been making the news a lot this year. First, a video showed Beyonce’s sister Solange Knowles attacking her brother-in-law, Jay-Z, in New York City’s Standard Hotel elevator. Then a video revealed Superbowl-winning running back Ray Rice beating and dragging his now-wife, Janay, from an Atlantic City casino elevator. Though the swanky elevators and the domestic violence they contained are strikingly similar, the world’s reactions to the two incidents couldn’t be more different. 

While Solange became the newest punch line for comedians, Rice became the face of domestic violence and a sore spot for the NFL’s image. [Saturday Night Live](http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/watch-saturday-night-love-jay-z-solange-knowles-spoof-1201185453/) opened their season finale with a skit unveiling the video’s “missing” audio of Solange and Jay-Z. It turns out Solange was just trying to kill a spider on Jay-Z! She’s a woman, after all. There’s no way she could’ve hurt the famous rapper, popular media seem to say, so let’s just have fun with it. 

Meanwhile, a deafening public outcry led to the NFL’s indefinite suspension of Rice and the rippling penalization of other players, including Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy. 

Is gender to blame for these starkly different reactions? Actors from the improv group OckTV staged a [social experiment](http://www.today.com/news/domestic-violence-social-experiment-what-would-you-do-2D80191075) to find out. A woman assaulted a man in one scenario and a man attacked a woman in the other. While people intervened to pull the man off the woman, they laughed, recorded and even helped the woman beating her boyfriend. 

[Friends and bystanders are a key resource](http://cms350.com/politics/keeping-an-arm-s-length-colleges-not-doing-much-to-address-dating-violence.html) in identifying domestic violence—a challenging task given the wide range of severity. But when people laugh at a dramatically obvious case of woman-on-man violence, how can we expect them to help fix this problem?

Ask anyone to define domestic violence, and they’ll likely describe a controlling man battering a hopeless woman. Rarely do we hear of a woman assaulting her intimate partner or family member. But over four decades of research show that women and men perform acts of domestic violence at [nearly equal rates](http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/intimate-partner-violence/Pages/measuring.aspx). 

The media microscope on the NFL has not only forced them to address domestic violence, but has also toppled the carefully placed dominos of the status quo. Before the Rice scandal, each of the [56 players charged with domestic violence](http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/11553070/why-hope-solo-suspended-team-usa-immediately) under commissioner Roger Goodell only missed a quarter of a game.

Now, it’s not just about professional football players—or men. First, [Benjamin Morris at _FiveThirtyEight_](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/) pointed out that NFL players are charged with domestic violence at lower rates than the general public. Instead, police officers are actually some of the biggest perpetrators. Then, the [_Washington Post_’s Cindy Boren](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/09/19/hope-solo-and-the-domestic-violence-case-no-one-is-talking-about/) criticized U.S. Soccer for allowing Hope Solo to continue playing despite being charged with punching her nephew and breaking a broom over her half-sister’s head last June. 

“While U.S. Soccer doesn’t have the same high profile as the NFL, how do the cases differ? Aren’t women’s soccer players just as much role models as male football players?” she writes. “Why is the notion of awaiting due process so inconsistently applied?” 

In a biting response, [_Slate_’s Amanda Hess](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/09/hope_solo_domestic_violence_it_is_very_very_stupid_to_compare_the_soccer.html) argues that while Boren’s calls for equal punishments are “worthy,” they’re unnecessary—U.S. Soccer would just be wasting their time trying to raise awareness of the problem. "But whether or not it’s the right call to suspend Hope Solo, how necessary is it for an institution like U.S. women’s soccer to send a message to young girls that it’s not OK to violently attack their family members?" she writes.

Hess also claims, “[The] perpetrators of domestic violence are overwhelmingly male, the victims are overwhelmingly female, and the violence that occurs between intimate partners represents a far more insidious form of abuse than that of a woman fighting with her extended family.” It’s not clear how she draws this false conclusion, given that the [data she sites](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ipvus.pdf) doesn’t include any perpetration rates by gender. 

She does get one thing right: her headline “No, Women’s Soccer Does Not Have A Domestic Violence Problem.” Of course women’s soccer doesn’t have a domestic violence problem, and neither does the NFL or the entire male sex. Domestic violence is everyone’s problem—one that costs the world [$8 trillion every month](http://freakonomics.com/2014/10/02/108967/). It’s a severe crime no matter who commits it. And now that the NFL has set a new precedent after years of turning a blind eye, employers of public figures should be expected to do the do the same. 

By ignoring Hope Solo’s attacks in lieu of [“an opportunity to set a significant record,”](http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/11553070/why-hope-solo-suspended-team-usa-immediately) U.S. Soccer is virtually saying that abuse by a woman can’t be that serious. All too soon the media and public forget the [murder of NFL player Steve McNair](http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2014-07-03/steve-mcnair-killed-five-year-anniversary-july-4-2009-memorial-family-celebration-fred-mcnair-titans) in 2009 by his girlfriend.

While their perpetration rates are nearly the same, [significantly more women] (http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf)report victimization. [Fearing they won’t be believed](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/12/domestic-violence-male-victims-embarrassment), male victims are less likely to report abuse and [follow through](http://brightonmanplan.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/male-victims-of-domestic-violence-suffering-in-silence/) with charges. While numerous educational campaigns urge female victims to seek help, virtually none do the same for male victims. 

Our perceptions of violence are gendered and so the consequences of that violence are too. Until men feel comfortable coming forward about their victimization, female perpetrators of domestic violence will be forgiven and forgotten. The feminist movement empowered women to speak out about domestic violence (though still grossly underreported), but inadvertently deepened the chasm of inequality for male victims. Now it’s time for a new feminism that treats violence as violence, without caveats or excuses based on the absence of a Y chromosome.
