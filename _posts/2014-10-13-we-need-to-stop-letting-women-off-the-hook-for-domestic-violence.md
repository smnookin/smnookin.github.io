Elevators have been making the news a lot this year. In May, a video showed Solange Knowles attacking her brother-in-law, Jay-Z, in the elevator of a New York City hotel. Then, in September, a video revealed Superbowl-winning running back Ray Rice beating his now-wife, Janay, unconscious in an Atlantic City casino elevator. Though the two swanky elevators both contained domestic violence, the world’s reactions to the two incidents couldn’t be more different. 

While a deafening public outcry led to the NFL’s indefinite suspension of Rice and the rippling penalization of other players, Solange just became the newest punch line for comedians. For instance, [Saturday Night Live](http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/watch-saturday-night-love-jay-z-solange-knowles-spoof-1201185453/) opened their season finale with a skit unveiling the video’s “missing” audio. It turns out Solange was just trying to kill a spider crawling on Jay-Z! Whew, what a relief.

In comparison to Rice's life-threatening assault, it _can_ seem comical when a slender 5'8" woman tries to kick a 6'2" man who calls himself the [best rapper alive](http://rap.genius.com/Jay-z-best-rapper-alive-lyrics). And it's true that women experience [more severe violence](http://dahmw.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/Common-Myths-about-Intimate-Partner-Violence-against-Men2012.pdf) than men and constitute the majority of homicide cases. But by brushing off and mocking seemingly harmless assaults, we become desensitized to the whole idea of a female batterer. 

Had the assaults by Rice and Knowles been more comprable, would our reactions have been the same? Actors from the improv group OckTV staged a [social experiment](http://www.today.com/news/domestic-violence-social-experiment-what-would-you-do-2D80191075) to find out. A woman assaulted a man in one scenario, and a man assaulted a woman in the other. While people intervened to pull the man off the woman, they laughed, recorded and even helped the woman attacking her boyfriend.

This isn't too surprising. Ask anyone to define domestic violence, and they’ll likely describe a controlling man battering a hopeless woman. Yet over forty years of research show that women and men perform acts of domestic violence at [nearly equal rates](http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/intimate-partner-violence/Pages/measuring.aspx). Nevertheless, _victims_ are [overwhelmingly female](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf), which explains why most educational campaigns and the media tend to focus on women. Measuring domestic violence is  messy though. And the numbers aren't completely reliable since cases are grossly underreported by both perpetrators and victims.

Male victims are especially unlikely to report and follow through with cases out of [fear they won’t be believed](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/12/domestic-violence-male-victims-embarrassment). They easily fall through the system's cracks, because the abuse they endure typically doesn't require emergency room attention. In fact, the abuse might not be physical at all, but rather [emotional or psychological](http://cms350.com/politics/keeping-an-arm-s-length-colleges-not-doing-much-to-address-dating-violence.html).

The media microscope on the Ray Rice scandal not only forced the NFL to upend their [typical response](http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/11553070/why-hope-solo-suspended-team-usa-immediately) to domestic violence, but has provoked the public to do the same. Now, the dialogue is not just about professional football players—or men. [_The Washington Post_’s Cindy Boren](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/09/19/hope-solo-and-the-domestic-violence-case-no-one-is-talking-about/) recently criticized U.S. Soccer for allowing Hope Solo to continue playing despite being charged with punching her nephew and breaking a broom over her half-sister’s head last June. 

“While U.S. Soccer doesn’t have the same high profile as the NFL, how do the cases differ? Aren’t women’s soccer players just as much role models as male football players?” Boren writes. “Why is the notion of awaiting due process so inconsistently applied?” 

In a biting response, [_Slate_’s Amanda Hess](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/09/hope_solo_domestic_violence_it_is_very_very_stupid_to_compare_the_soccer.html) argues that while Boren’s calls for equal punishments are “worthy,” they’re unnecessary—U.S. Soccer would just be wasting their time trying to raise awareness of the problem. "But whether or not it’s the right call to suspend Hope Solo, how necessary is it for an institution like U.S. women’s soccer to send a message to young girls that it’s not OK to violently attack their family members?" she writes.

Hess also claims that the "perpetrators of domestic violence are overwhelmingly male, the victims are overwhelmingly female, and the violence that occurs between intimate partners represents a far more insidious form of abuse than that of a woman fighting with her extended family.” It’s not clear how she draws this inaccurate conclusion, given that the [data she sites](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ipvus.pdf) doesn’t include any perpetration rates by gender or effects of family violence.

She does get one thing right: her headline “No, Women’s Soccer Does Not Have A Domestic Violence Problem.” Of course, women’s soccer doesn’t have a domestic violence problem, nor does the NFL. And men aren't the only ones with the problem either. Domestic violence is everyone’s problem—-one that costs the world a steep [$8 trillion every month](http://freakonomics.com/2014/10/02/108967/). 

But because our perceptions of violence are gendered, the consequences of that violence are too. Until men feel comfortable coming forward about their victimization, female perpetrators will be forgiven and forgotten. The feminist movement empowered women to speak out about domestic violence, but inadvertently deepened the chasm of inequality for male victims. As actress and new UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, Emma Watson said in her [recent speech](http://www.eonline.com/news/581276/emma-watson-gives-emotional-powerful-speech-at-u-n-about-gender-inequality-check-out-a-transcript-and-a-video), “Men don't have the benefits of equality, either."

And men aren't the only ones scarred when we let female perpetrators off the hook. Countless studies have shown that children raised in a home of domestic violence are likely to continue the [cycle of abuse](http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/February-2013/The-Importance-of-Knowing-Why-the-Cycle-of-Domestic-Violence-Is-Hard-to-Break/). It's time for a new feminism that treats violence as violence, without caveats or excuses based on sex.
