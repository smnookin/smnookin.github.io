![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mcd-times_square.JPG/320px-Mcd-times_square.JPG)    Welcome, may I take your order? Across the United States, fast food employees are switching the script and making some demands of their own. These workers, including many in the Boston area, have staged strikes and other acts of civil disobedience. 

Their goal is to improve their working conditions and secure raises to $15 an hour. But unlike traditional labor efforts, fast food workers are organizing without the help of a union. 

That was also the situation with a high-profile case this summer, when the non-unionized employees of the supermarket chain Market Basket staged a month-long walk-out to reinstate the company's former president, Arthur T. Demoulas, after he was dismissed by the store's board of directors. Their campaign was successful -- although there's no guarantee their competitive wages and generous benefits will remain in place if Demoulas retires. Though the Market Basket case was thought by some to be an inspiring landmark moment in labor history, it is unclear if the case could be replicated elsewhere.

While the Market Basket employees didn't want to be unionized, that is not the case with fast food workers, whose "Fight for $15" rallying cry 
' non-union association, rallied across corporations and franchises under the banner of “Fight for $15,” is demanding the right to form a union, as well as a $15 an hour wage and the ability to take sick leave. While fast food is one of the [fastest-growing labor sectors](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/business/majority-of-new-jobs-pay-low-wages-study-finds.html?_r=0) in the United States, many workers are paid [barely enough to live](http://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-worker-says-why-hes-striking-2014-9) and often must [rely on public assistance](http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/pdf/2013/fast_food_poverty_wages.pdf) to meet basic needs.

The campaign began with an strike in New York City, in November of 2012. Since then, their walkouts and acts of civil disobedience across the country have garnered international attention.

According to Harris Gruman, Massachusetts Political Director of the SEIU, fast food workers have been “neglected for... the whole history of the labor movement because it's so hard to organize people who are working for big corporations.” The separation of franchises' responsibility from their corporations makes it more difficult for unions to organize workers, as it limits them to targeting individual restaurants, rather than organizing across the corporation.

For example, the McDonald's Corporation has claimed that individual franchises are responsible for setting workers' wages, not the corporation itself. However, a recent court case against McDonald's ruled that franchises are “subservient to the big corporations”, which has made it “arguable that [labor organizers] should be able to organize multiple, or even all McDonald's, for example, as a union,” said Gruman.

The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has given the fast food workers' movement financial support and the help of their union organizers throughout their campaign. In the past, the SEIU has aligned itself with the struggles of hospital workers, janitors, and home aides, to much success. Their campaign, [Justice for Janitors](http://www.seiu-usww.org/category/campaigns/justice-for-janitors/), has succeeded in organizing 225,000 custodial workers nationwide since its [inception in 1990](http://socialjusticehistory.org/projects/justiceforjanitors/timeline). It is only recently that the SEIU has become involved with fast food workers.

Because of their previous work unionizing home care aides, the SEIU called on aides to assist the fast food workers with their strike, joining them in the streets for marches and acts of civil disobedience, in the hopes that it will foster more solidarity across the two groups and strengthen both of their fights. Thus, not only have the strikes united workers from different restaurants and fast food corporations, but they also have united workers across very different working sectors.

The most recent fast food workers' action, on September 4th of this year, was a nationwide strike and series of protests. Workers and their supporters from over 100 cities, including home care aides, participated.

On October 10th, several bands from HONK!, the annual Somerville-based radical marching band festival, will join the workers downtown for a celebratory protest, full of music, performance, and dance. The hope behind this “day of action” is that it may attract the attention of passers-by who may not otherwise get involved in the efforts.
