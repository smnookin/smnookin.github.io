![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/708/657/400/DSC_0002.jpg)This remarkable essay by Didion ran in a 1967 _Saturday Evening Post_ special issue on the "Hippie Cult." <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/21W/fa13/21W.737/courseMaterial/topics/topic7/readings/Didion_Slouching_Towards_Bethlehem/Didion_Slouching_Towards_Bethlehem.pdf">The piece</a> also lent its name to Didion's first nonfiction collection, which describes her experiences living in California in the 1960s. Didion's essays are a prime example of New Journalism: a creative form of truth-telling, combining narrative arcs and literary techniques with journalistic fact.
