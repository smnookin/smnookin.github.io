In a famous 2010 piece in _The New Yorker_, physician-journalist <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/02/100802fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all" target="_blank">**Atul Gawande** explores if and when it's best for doctors to stop treating their patients</a>. 
"'Is she dying?' one of the sisters asked me. I didn’t know how to answer the question. I wasn’t even sure what the word 'dying' meant anymore. In the past few decades, medical science has rendered obsolete centuries of experience, tradition, and language about our mortality, and created a new difficulty for mankind: how to die."
