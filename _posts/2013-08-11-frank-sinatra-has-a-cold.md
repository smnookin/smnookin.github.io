In the early 1960s, Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese helped pioneer New Journalism with their deliberately subjective, self-consciously literary styles of reportage. In the winter of 1965, Talese went to Los Angeles to profile a middle-aged, recalcitrant Frank Sinatra. Sinatra refused to be interviewed -- so Talese spent his time talking to anyone and everyone he could. "Frank Sinatra has a Cold" ran in Esquire the following spring -- and helped give birth to the modern-day profile. <a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ1003-OCT_SINATRA_rev_">External Link</a>
