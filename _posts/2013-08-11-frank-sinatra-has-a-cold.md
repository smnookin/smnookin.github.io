![](http://sethmnookin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Sinatra-4-3.png)In the early 1960s, Tom Wolfe and **Gay Talese** helped pioneer New Journalism with their deliberately subjective, self-consciously literary styles of reportage. In the winter of 1965, <A href="http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ1003-OCT_SINATRA_rev_" target="_blank">Talese went to Los Angeles to profile a middle-aged, recalcitrant Frank Sinatra</a>. Sinatra refused to be interviewed -- so Talese spent his time talking to anyone and everyone he could. "Frank Sinatra has a Cold" ran in Esquire the following spring -- and helped give birth to the modern-day profile.
