## Real Life Fiction:
### The (Almost) Impossible Story of Twitter’s Rise

_I recommend viewing this piece on the following site, until I get the formatting better on this version. The plain text is below (for now): [Link to Online Version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/odcbhtjl08ov0h3/Book%20Review.pdf?dl=0)_

Fiction is intense. It’s detailed. Action packed. It reads like the script of an action movie. Plot lines and narratives too specific — and too bizarre — for real life.

But fiction does has it’s weak spots. It’s not as nuanced as real life. An author’s imagination can’t possibly capture the chaotic and minuscule events of the world. In fiction, it feels like you’re in a movie, but you also know you’re in a movie.

But what if you could combine fiction and nonfiction? What if you could have all of the details and action with the nuance and complexity of a real story? That’s just what Nick Bilton has done with Hatching Twitter.

Bilton, a New York Times columnist and Vanity Fair contributor, found the perfect company to write about as a tech journalist. Twitter is poster-child of 21st century internet startup: started by white young males, headquartered in San Fransisco, and a fight for credit as the true founder. Twitter is also a breeding ground for technologists and journalists alike looking for breaking news and bleeding edge information. You might see a tweet “Just felt that earthquake” before you feel the tremor.

But the biggest benefit of writing a book about Twitter is Twitter itself: all of the early developments and conversations about Twitter happened on Twitter. The record is embedded in itself. Bilton went through 1000s of tweets from the earliest days of Twitter to investigate. He interviewed everyone on of the 4 founders as well, accumulating over 60 hours of interviews. But the genius is in the tweets.

You can be sure that when Bilton says ““11:40 A.M., the moment Ev would finish addressing the company and hand the microphone to the new CEO” you can be sure it took place at exactly 11:40. The tweets are there to prove it.

This brings a sense of vividness that is rarely seen in nonfiction. As you read, you feel like you are sitting in the board room chair with Jack, Ev, Noah, and Biz.

The book is divided into 5 parts: one for each founder plus an introduction. Each section focuses on a particular founder. While it works well for the first few founders, the formula begins to get repetitive. By the time you get to part 5 “Dick,” you begin to wonder when the story will end with a happily ever after message.

_They met at Bacar, a California fusion restaurant, in early August. The smell of burning wood drifted through the air as they both doused their uncomfortable feelings with a few large glasses of alcohol. After long stretches of silence that were punctured by short bursts of small talk, they got down to business. “What’s going on?” Jack asked Ev as they waited for their meal to be served. “You don’t seem happy.”_

It’s all a true story, so you can’t blame Bilton for weaknesses in the plot. However the origin story of Twitter is so muddled that it can be hard to wrap your head around. For the most part, Bilton does a good job of cleaning up the rough patches, but when there are 4 CEOs within 5 years, and 2 of them are the same person, it can be hard to keep track of all the details.

Bilton excels in the investigative part of creating this book. With so many fights for power and money, the book excels at getting to the root of the issues. Hatching Twitter is  known for finally crediting Noah Glass as one of the founders (a detail which the other founders often don’t mention).

_what are you doing?
or
what’s happening?_

Bilton also hits a meaningful extensional question of Twitter: what is it? Is it a social network? A broadcasting platform? Is it a microblogging service or a status updating service? Diving into these questions not only gets at the heart of what Twitter is, but which founder is in control: who won.

The book ends in the year that it was published, late 2013. Things in the technology world change so quickly, that less than 2 years later, it might be time to write a second edition. Since the book was published, Twitter went public (with a declining stock price ever since) and has changed founders again.

One more thing: in the digital version, the references and sources should be included — at least the tweets. They are already public, and Bilton must have already catalogued them. It would be great to see a tweet, such as Jack saying “just setting up my twttr,” in the text, and then go to the actual tweet by clicking on it. (Bilton, sell that as a $5 In App Purchase for an app version of the book. Give me 10% for the idea).
