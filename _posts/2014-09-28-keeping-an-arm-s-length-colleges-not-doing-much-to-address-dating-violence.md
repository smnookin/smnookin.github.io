When Bill Mitchell first received the call about his daughter’s death, he was shocked. Unconvinced the person on the other end was even a real detective, he asked to meet in the parking lot of a nearby supermarket. That’s where he heard what happened: his twenty-one-year-old daughter, Kristin, had been stabbed to death by her boyfriend of about four months. “You have no idea on earth that this could possibly happen to you,” he says. 

It wasn’t until the drive home that reality began to sink in. “I was saying out loud in the car, ‘no Christmas, no birthdays, no weddings, no grandchildren,’” Mitchell says. “I was just reciting all these things that I realized weren’t going to happen.”

Since Kristin’s death more than nine years ago, Mitchell and his wife have been running an organization in her name aimed at increasing awareness about dating violence at colleges. “I think it really has the appearance of being put at arm’s length,” Mitchell tells me over the phone, while sitting in his daughter’s bedroom. He says that if a college provides any education about dating violence, it’s over and done with pretty quickly—like Take Back the Night, an awareness week every April.

When the video of NFL player [Ray Rice punching and dragging his then-fiancée](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/sports/football/ray-rice-video-shows-punch-and-raises-new-questions-for-nfl.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar) from a hotel elevator surfaced online, the issue of intimate partner violence hit the national radar. Typically, domestic violence is suffered invisibly by the victim or reported as a tragic death on the local evening news, Mitchell says.

“It happens, people see it, they think it’s awful, then they get up tomorrow and go on with their lives,” Mitchell says. Most people, including himself-ten-years-ago, think that intimate partner violence could never affect their lives. But here’s the thing: intimate partner violence is [happening all around](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/), and it’s certainly not unique to high-profile athletes and [celebrities](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/25/modern-family-star-sarah-hyland-gets-restraining-order-against-ex-boyfriend/). In fact, teens and young adults experience it more than any other group.

Intimate partner violence—also called domestic violence and dating violence—is difficult to define, says Katie Edwards, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire who researches teen dating violence. Broadly speaking, [it includes](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html) any physical, emotional, and sexual abuse in a couple that dates now or dated in the past. But depending on how you qualify “abuse,” the [portion of affected college students](http://www.breakthecycle.org/dating-violence-research/college-dating-violence-and-abuse-poll) varies dramatically: from 22 percent when considering only physical violence, to 43 percent when counting emotional and “[digital abuse](http://www.loveisrespect.org/is-this-abuse/types-of-abuse/what-is-digital-abuse),” like stalking a partner through Facebook or pressuring her to send explicit photos.

A number of things increase your odds of being in an abusive relationship, like witnessing domestic violence in childhood or being a victim of child abuse, says Andrea Roberts, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health who studies trauma and stress. In reality though, dating violence can happen to anyone. Mitchell says Kristin was a kind, “fixer-upper” type, who would do anything for a friend and felt it her responsibility to mend her troubled boyfriend. “I don’t think that she ever believed that somebody she liked or was dating would ever do something like this,
 he says. “She was very trusting.”  But what she saw as problems to fix, like his controlling behavior, were actually warning signs of a sharp, violent turn. From Mitchell’s understanding, Kristin was trying to break up with him the night she was killed.

[Studies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735899000422) and experts indicate that students in abusive relationships are often too embarrassed to go to their parents or college administrators, but sometimes confide in their friends. Kristin’s friends told Mitchell that they thought something was off with her boyfriend, but he hadn’t really abused her—not physically anyways. That’s why Mitchell thinks colleges should require mandatory training on the [warning signs](http://www.theredflagcampaign.org/index.php/dating-violence/red-flags-for-abusive-relationships/) of dating violence—like serious mood swings or scouring your email without permission. Edwards says that students with peer groups that support and believe them are typically more resilient and have less health outcomes from dating violence. “Your friends have a better chance of saving you than you do,” Mitchell says. “Love is blind. You’re going to discount those things that under different circumstances might bother you.” 

If an educational session on the red flags of dating violence were optional like it is at most schools, Mitchell suspects Kristin and her friends would think it doesn’t apply to them and skip out. And that’s if the school has a program to begin with. Colleges are even further behind in addressing dating violence than sexual assault, Edwards says. According to Edwards and her colleagues’ research, only 34 percent of New England colleges conduct dating sessions during freshman orientation, compared to half of the colleges with sessions on sexual assault. Given this year’s media microscope on colleges for the handling of lawsuits and a new [White House Task Force](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/22/memorandum-establishing-white-house-task-force-protect-students-sexual-a) on sexual assault, that percentage is likely to rise. But clearly there’s a lot of work to be done for both issues.

While certain factors like substance abuse and a history of violence are linked to both sexual assault and dating violence, that doesn’t mean they should be targeted in one fell swoop. The two issues are similar but distinct. “It’s important to talk about them together rather than in a vacuum, but also recognizing that there are some differences,” Edwards says. Sexual assault involves a sexual act performed against the victim’s will and can be perpetrated by anyone. While sexual assault is typically a one-time event, dating violence is often a chronic issue in a relationship. The abuse may be sexual, but can also be emotional, physical, or even financial.

Many colleges just tuck dating violence away in a corner of their revamped sexual assault websites, or conflate the two problems as one and the same. “It obviously doesn’t get the attention it so richly deserves,” Mitchell says. When I contacted Harvard about their efforts to deal with dating violence, I received four news articles about the high-profile experts they hired to tackle the sexual assault controversy that placed the school under federal investigation. “That’s great,” I responded. “But what about dating violence?” I still haven’t heard back.

Sexual assault programs have been around longer and have more sustainable funding than dating violence ones. Mitchell thinks this is because people don’t really know what it is or believe it happens all that much. When he solicited Congress members for funding a couple years ago, they asked, ‘Wait a minute, what is this now? Why would some guy dating a girl beat her up?’ “It’s like they don’t have a clue,” he says. “If you’re dealing with that level of lack of education and information, then imagine trying to ask someone to fund it or take it seriously.”

Edwards agrees that colleges need to shift the current attitudes toward violence. In her research, she’s found that young people often recognize the severe forms of dating violence, like stalking and beatings. But most of the time, the abuse is more moderate, like mandating when you can see your friends and family. Colleges should make it clear that all forms of violence are unacceptable and empower students to speak up, she says. The [bystander intervention](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/education/edlife/stepping-up-to-stop-sexual-assault.html) aims to do just that. Adapted by a number of colleges, bystander intervention programs equip students with the agency and skills to prevent and respond to violence. Instead of trying to change the personality of the individual perpetrator or victim, it approaches dating violence at the community level. 

The NFL has brought this issue to the forefront. “One way or another, you can’t get away from it,” Mitchell says. But he thinks it’s going to take a public outcry from the students to really get the ball rolling on prevention. “Nothing is going to turn it around faster than the student population getting together and going to the administration and saying, we demand this training,” he says.
