![](http://www.todayonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/photo_gallery_image_lightbox/public/16171614.JPG?itok=TvPiLH4U)Cities have had a long tradition of burrowing underground, but Singapore – the densest nation in the world at 19,562 people per sq. mi – is about to go one step further. 

The amount of below ground infrastructure needed to power contemporary cities requires sewage systems, telephone wires, data-lines, etc. On top of this, many modern cities have embraced the efficiency of building mass transit lines underground. Others, like Montreal and Tokyo, have gone so far as to build substantial subterranean commercial/retail space, making for a much more pleasant shopping experience come wintertime. 

Building primary living/working spaces underground allows countries to effectively use the same plot of land twice. Other cities beside Singapore have also considered underground living.  Alternative Multifunctional Underground Space Amsterdam, or AMFORA, was developed by Zwarts & Jansma Architects in 2008 as a way to solve inner-city congestion. The plan involved 50 km of tunnels for parking, sporting facilities and entertainment complexes, but, as with many ambitious, large-scale building projects, never made it out of the development phase. Construction on the Singapore project, however, is already underway,  despite many residents’ aversion to the idea.

The Singapore project JTC Corporation, Singapore’s primary developer and manager of industry related facilities, is leading the project. Previously, JTC has led the development and design of business, biomedical and clean-tech parks. One of the city’s more ambitious proposals is to construct a 20-hectare underground science city for R&D laboratories, data centers, and the storage of oil and petrochemicals. Typically, these types of research/industry heavy facilities are situated away from the city center. If you’re ever in Singapore and see a monolithic tower with no windows walking down the street, it is probably storage of some kind. Because there will be computer servers inside, they will need to be cool and dry inside, which, depending on the natural climactic conditions of the area, could mean constant air-conditioning. 

Of course, if building underground were easy, everyone would be doing it, but the added complications result in a final bill that can be up to four times more expensive than aboveground development. Initial steps prior to excavation include conducting an environmental impact assessment on the maximum size that can be built, investigating the soil and rock properties of the specific site, determining the method of excavation, analyzing the behavior of people who work indoors for long periods of time and potential psychological effects of working underground for extended periods of time and establishing emergency protocols, especially for the petrochemical storage. 

It remains to be seen whether or not these initiatives for subterranean living are a viable solution to the challenge of over-densification, not only for the technological hurdles, but the psychological ones.
