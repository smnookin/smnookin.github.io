In 21W.737 students will create their own on-line news site through news stories, blog posts, and feature-length profiles. We will examine how to draw readers in -- and in doing so, will focus on ways to make our own writing for accessible and inviting. The course meets Mondays from 2pm to 5pm in <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=26" target="_blank">26-142</a>. More information -- including the syllabus, readings, and assignments -- can be found on <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/21W/fa13/21W.737/" target="_blank">Stellar</a>. You can also <a href="mailto:smnookin@mit.edu" target="_blank">email the instructor, Assistant Professor Seth Mnookin</a>, with any questions.</p>
