In 21W.737 students will create their own on-line news site through news stories, blog posts, and feature-length profiles. We will examine how to draw readers in -- and in doing so, will focus on ways to make our own writing for accessible and inviting. The course meets Mondays from 2pm to 5pm in <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=26" target="_blank">26-142</a>. More information -- including the syllabus, readings, and assignments -- can be found on <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/21W/fa13/21W.737/" target="_blank">Stellar</a>. You can also <a href="mailto:smnookin@mit.edu" target="_blank">email the instructor, Assistant Professor Seth Mnookin</a>, with any questions.</p>


The practice and production of journalism is undergoing revolutionary changes. These are the result of a unique convergence of factors, including a societal-wide de-centralization of power, the advent of the Internet, the drying up of traditional revenue sources, and the unprecedented ability of consumers to create information cocoons in which they’re only exposed to viewpoints that confirm their worldviews. Despite the fervent hope of many in the journalism community, these changes are secular and not cyclical: We will never return to an era when a handful of news organizations have the money, the resources, and the reach to dictate what stories the public should consider worthy of its attention.

The diminishment of these traditional gatekeepers has far-reaching consequences. We now have access to more varied types of information, from more diverse sources, than at any other time in history. This presents unique opportunities: We can access newsmakers directly through social media and blogs; we can follow local coverage of events unfolding anywhere in the world; we can undertake civic media projects for stories we feel are not being covered adequately. It also confers exceptional responsibility on us as journalism’s end users. In a world where The New York Times exists in an undifferentiated online landscape with tweets and Facebook updates, being a fully informed member of society is impossible without knowing how to be an intelligent consumer of information.
  
“Topics in 21st Century Journalism” will do exactly that. Through in-depth scrutiny of a range of subjects and modes of practice, the course will give students the tools they need to be actively engaged with their media diets.
