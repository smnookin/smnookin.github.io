title: Examining MIT’s New Drug Policy
---


When an alcohol-fueled night turns into an emergency, MIT policy generally dictates that students calling for help won't be punished for violating campus alcohol rules. But for emergencies involving illegal drugs, students are not guaranteed the same protection, causing some MIT administration to question whether the policy deters students from getting help when they need it most.

In [INSERT YEAR], the Institute reviewed a proposed policy that would protect students involved in drug-related emergencies. On [INSERT DATE], [SOPHOMORE? JUNIOR? INSERT YEAR IN SCHOOL HERE] [STUDENT'S NAME] distributed an unknown substance originally thought to be LSD to a group of [friends?] at [insert location]. The substance caused adverse reactions in [INSERT NUMBER] of [party-goers?], leading to [INSERT NUMBER] of hospitalizations at [INSERT HOSPITAL]. MIT administration launched an [INTERNAL?] investigation following the incident, and arrested [STUDENT'S NAME] [INSERT NUMBER] days later. 

[DID EVERYONE INVOLVED RECOVER? DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TOTAL MEDICAL BILLS WERE? WAS IT EVER REVEALED WHAT THE SUBSTANCE WAS? IF THIS INFO IS AVAILABLE, BUILD IT IN. ALSO, HOW DID MIT FIND OUT ABOUT THE HOSPITALIZATION? DID THE HOSPITAL CALL OR DID THE COPS? DID MIT LAUNCH THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION OR WAS IT MANDATED FROM POLICE?]. 

Concerned that the arrest would deter other students from calling for help in the future, [INSERT NUMBER] of MIT administrators including [NAME ONE OR TWO HERE IF THEY ARE PROMINENT PEOPLE] crafted a proposal [CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION?] that would offer immunity to students involved in drug-related emergencies. [WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT PROPOSAL? DID IT GO THROUGH? WAS IT SHOT DOWN?]

[INSERT QUOTE HERE FROM SOMEONE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHO CAN COMMENT ON THE GOALS OF THE PROPOSAL AND/OR IT'S STATUS. ALSO, DOES THE PROPOSAL HAVE A NAME? IS IT OFFICIALLY CALLED THE GOOD SAMARITAN POLICY?]

The new "Good Samaritan" proposal for drug-related emergencies attempts to mirror MIT's current policy for alcohol-related emergencies, but differs in a few key ways. Unlike the alcohol policy which generally protects students except in cases involving “violence, harassment, [or] serious property damage,” the new proposal is much more ambiguous, warning that each drug-related incident will be individually reviewed by MIT to determine if it warrants "additional administrative or disciplinary action.” The new proposal also does not protect students in circumstances involving “the sale, distribution, enabling the use of (e.g. ‘spotting’), or sharing" prohibited substances.

Don Camelio, Director of MIT’s Office of Community Development and Substance Abuse, says that the new proposal is worded differently than the current alcohol policy because it attempts to separate drug dealers from casual users, and allow university administration to pursue the former with greater severity. “We want to make sure [the new proposal] works as well as it can possibly work to save people’s lives," he says. "We also want to be able to hold accountable the people who do things that we feel jeopardize the safety of other students.” 

Not everyone is convinced. Sophomore [INSERT NAME OR STATE THAT STUDENT WOULD RATHER HAVE NAME WITHHELD] says that the proposal is detrimental “because a student who is unsure if they will get in trouble won’t call for help.” The proposal's protection exemption for spotting—-the act of watching over someone who's currently using drugs—-also raised frustrations. Spotting, or trip sitting, is "specifically designed to make a drug experience safer," says junior [INSERT NAME]. “It’s disappointing that they would single out trip sitting because it’s like they’re trying to ban drug use by banning safe drug use.”

Don Camelio says that the goal of the Good Samaritan proposal is to reduce harm and invites students who have questions or concerns to direct them to his office. He adds that in light of student pushback, MIT administration plans to review and possibly reword the policy [WHEN? ALSO, I'M STILL NOT SURE IF THIS IS A POLICY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ENACTED OR A PROPOSAL UNDER REVIEW], though it's unclear when those potential changes would take effect. Until then, both students and administration are struggling the find the best way to deal with drug-related emergencies.
