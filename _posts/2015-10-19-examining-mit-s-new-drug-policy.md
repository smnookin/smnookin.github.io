title: Examining MIT’s New Drug Policy

When an alcohol-fueled night turns into an emergency, MIT's Help Seeking Practice policy, often referred to as the Good Samaritan rule, dictates that students calling for help won't be punished for violating campus alcohol rules. But for emergencies involving illegal drugs, students were not guaranteed the same protection, causing some to question whether the policy deters students from getting help when they need it most.
  
Following on the heels of a successfully reformed alcohol-related Help Seeking Practice, the latest issue of the Mind and Hand book included a similar policy for drug-related emergencies. This new “Practice for Seeking Help in a Prohibited Substance-Related Medical Emergencies” attempts to mirror the wording of the alcohol Good Samaritan policy, thereby offering the same level of assurance as the successful alcohol policy.

Many members of the MIT community agree, though, that the new drug Help Seeking Practice fails to grasp what made the alcohol policy effective. Unlike the alcohol policy, which generally protects students except in cases involving “violence, harassment, [or] serious property damage,” the way drugs are treated is much more ambiguous. To start with, each drug-related incident will be individually reviewed by MIT to determine if it warrants "additional administrative or disciplinary action.” Students also will not be protected in circumstances involving “the sale, distribution, enabling the use of (e.g. ‘spotting’), or sharing" of prohibited substances, which are much more common in situations involving illegal drug use.

Don Camelio, director of MIT’s office of Community Development and Substance Abuse, said that “[the policy] doesn’t read exactly the same way, but the spirit of it is actually the same.” He explained that the goal of the policy is “to reduce harm.” Drugs are treated differently from alcohol because of the need to separate drug dealers from casual users. Mr. Camelio said, “I know that people buy drugs and use drugs together, but that’s different than mass provision to people.”
 
Once again, these terms are loosely defined, and some students remain skeptical. “This new policy doesn’t really help,” said one MIT sophomore, “because a student who is unsure if they will get in trouble won’t call for help.” Frustration surrounds the explicit banning of “enabling the use of (e.g. ‘spotting’)” of prohibited substances - the act of watching over someone who's currently using drugs – which one MIT junior describes as “specifically designed to make a drug experience safer.” This student continued, “It’s like they’re trying to ban drug use by banning safe drug use.”

For Mr. Camelio, this is not at all the goal of the policy. “We want to make sure [the policy] works as well as it can possibly work to save people’s lives, and we also want to be able to hold accountable the people who do things that we feel jeopardize the safety of other students.” 

Mr. Camelio also explained that “there’s a policy group that’s going to be convened again” which will review and possibly reword the policy in light of these issues. This might be reassuring for students who feel the policy should be updated, but provides no help for students who may remain unsure of where this policy draws the line. 

As the policy evolves, many students hope to see these issues addressed and corrected, and, in the meantime, they are encouraged by the administration to direct any questions they may have about the policy to Mr. Camelio’s office. 

Referring to the old drug policy, one MIT senior said, “I know people who have not called the police specifically because of [the] policy,” and both students and administrators agree that this is the last thing the Good Samaritan policy should do.
