title: Examining MIT’s New Drug Policy
---

Should a student be punished when calling for help for others? If the emergency is alcohol-related, and there are no other egregious violations of MIT policy, the MIT administration says no. However, students are not guaranteed the same level of protection for emergencies involving other prohibited substances.

Take a case that occurred several years ago. An MIT student was distributing a substance that the student believed was LSD, but was not. The substance caused several adverse reactions, some resulting in hospitalization, and in response to these emergencies the administration conducted an investigation and apprehended the student responsible. 

Clearly, in a case such as this, an administrative investigation in response to emergency reports is to be expected. However, many administrators and members of the MIT community were concerned that students would not call for help in a drug-related emergency out of fear of disciplinary or legal repercussions. There was an appeal for a policy to provide assurances for students who called for help in a drug-related emergency, promising that they would not be punished for MIT policy violations related to the emergency. The MIT administration is now faced with the question: how can a policy protect the safety of students and ensure them amnesty when seeking medical attention without condoning illegal activity? 

For the past several years, the MIT administration has been developing policies to help reduce barriers for students seeking emergency assistance. These policies are designed to assure students who call for help in an emergency that they are protected from disciplinary action. Following on the heels of a successfully reformed alcohol-related emergency response policy, the latest issue of the Mind and Hand book included a similar policy for drug-related emergencies. This new “Good Samaritan Policy” attempts to mirror the wording of the alcohol Good Samaritan Policy, thereby offering the same level of assurance as the successful alcohol policy.

Many members of the MIT community agree, though, that the new drug Good Samaritan Policy fails to grasp what made the alcohol policy effective. The wording of the alcohol Good Samaritan Policy is broad, reassuring, and unambiguous, the kind of language necessary to convince a scared student that it’s okay to call for help. There are a few cases where the alcohol Good Samaritan Policy will not protect a student, but they are defined as “serious or flagrant violations of MIT policy,” such as “violence, harassment, [or] serious property damage,” which many members of the MIT community feel are sufficient justifications for further administrative action. 

When compared to the alcohol Good Samaritan Policy, the drug Good Samaritan Policy shows major differences. There is one crucial line that appears in the drug Good Samaritan Policy and does not appear in the alcohol Good Samaritan Policy: “Each incident will be reviewed to determine if the situation warrants additional administrative or disciplinary action.” This line seems to undermine the entire purpose of the drug Good Samaritan Policy, sowing uncertainty where it should be providing assurances. Also, the policy does not protect against situations involving “the sale, distribution, enabling the use of (e.g. ‘spotting’), or sharing of prohibited substances,” which are much more common in situations involving illegal drug use.

Don Camelio, director of MIT’s office of Community Development and Substance Abuse, said that “[the policy] doesn’t read exactly the same way, but the spirit of it is actually the same.” He explained that the goal of the policy is “to reduce harm.” By reducing harm, Mr. Camelio seemed to mean that the policy attempts to isolate drug usage, allowing the administration to pursue dealers or other students who would likely perpetuate drug use on campus. Mr. Camelio said, “I know that people buy drugs and use drugs together, but that’s different than mass provision to people.”
 
Once again, though, these terms are loosely defined, and some students remain frustrated at the ambiguity of this policy. “This new policy doesn’t really help,” said one MIT sophomore, “because a student who is unsure if they will get in trouble won’t call for help.” Frustration surrounds the explicit banning of “enabling the use of (e.g. ‘spotting’)” of prohibited substances, an act one MIT junior describes as “specifically designed to make a drug experience safer.” This student continued, “It’s disappointing that they would single out trip sitting because it’s like they’re trying to ban drug use by banning safe drug use.”

For Mr. Camelio, this is not at all the goal of the policy. “We want to make sure [the policy] works as well as it can possibly work to save people’s lives, and we also want to be able to hold accountable the people who do things that we feel jeopardize the safety of other students.” 

Mr. Camelio also explained that “there’s a policy group that’s going to be convened again” which will review and possibly reword the policy in light of these issues. This might be reassuring for students who feel the policy should be updated, but provides no help for students who may remain unsure of where this policy draws the line. 

As the policy evolves, many students hope to see these issues addressed and corrected, and, in the meantime, they are encouraged by the administration to direct any questions they may have about the policy to Mr. Camelio’s office. 

Referring to the old drug policy, one MIT senior said, “I know people who have not called the police specifically because of [the] policy,” and both students and administrators agree that this is the last thing the Good Samaritan Policy should do.
