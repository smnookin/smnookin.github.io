title: Examining MIT’s New Drug Policy

When an alcohol-fueled night turns into an emergency, MIT's Help Seeking Practice policy, often referred to as the Good Samaritan rule, dictates that students calling for help won't be punished for violating campus alcohol rules. But for emergencies involving illegal drugs, students were not guaranteed the same protection, causing some to question whether the policy deters students from getting help when they need it most.

These concerns were heightened after a series of incidents in recent years, including one in INSERT YEAR in which a YEAR OF STUDENT (EX: "...including one in 2014 in which a sophomore gave out a substance...) gave out what S/HE thought was LSD to classmates. After the substance caused a number of adverse reactions and several hospitalizations, MIT identified and expelled the student in question. (IS THIS CORRECT)

INSERT QUOTE HERE FROM SOMEONE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHO CAN COMMENT ON WHY EXTENDING POLICY TO DRUGS WAS NEEDED. 

So, INSERT YEAR, several MIT administrators, including NAMES, decided to extend the Good Samaritan policy to cover drugs as well -- although there are several key differences in how drugs and alcohol are treated. Unlike the alcohol policy, which generally protects students except in cases involving “violence, harassment, [or] serious property damage,” the way drugs are treated is much more ambiguous. To start with, each drug-related incident will be individually reviewed by MIT to determine if it warrants "additional administrative or disciplinary action.” Students also will not be protected in circumstances involving “the sale, distribution, enabling the use of (e.g. ‘spotting’), or sharing" of prohibited substances.

Don Camelio, Director of MIT’s Office of Community Development and Substance Abuse, says that the drugs are treated differently from alcohol because of the need to separate drug dealers from casual users. “We want to make sure this works as well as it can possibly work to save people’s lives," he says. "We also want to be able to hold accountable the people who do things that we feel jeopardize the safety of other students.” 

Some students, however, remain skeptcial. "A student who is unsure if they will get in trouble won’t call for help,” said one sophomore. (All of the students quoted request that their names be withheld because of the sensitivity of the issue.) The drug policy's exemption for spotting—-the act of watching over someone who's currently using drugs—-is another area that has raised concerns. Spotting, or trip sitting, is "specifically designed to make a drug experience safer," one junior said. “It’s disappointing that they would single out trip sitting because it’s like they’re trying to ban drug use by banning safe drug use.”

Camelio says students who have questions or concerns should contact his office. Already, he said, student pushback has resulted in potentially rewording parts of the policy RELATED TO WHICH ASPECTS?
