21W.737/CMS.350 will give students a broad understanding of what it means to produce journalism today. We will do this by evaluating the limitations and strengths of specific types of media, ranging from <a href="http://nytimes.com" target="_blank">_The New York Times_</a> to Twitter feeds - and in doing so, we will develop tools to effectively communicate our own work and research to non-specialist audiences. Students submit assignments via <a href="http://21w737.com">an online portal</a>, which mimics the style and substance of an online news source. The course meets Mondays from 2pm to 5pm in <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=26" target="_blank">26-142</a>. More information -- including the syllabus, readings, and assignments -- can be found on <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/21W/fa13/21W.737/" target="_blank">Stellar</a>. You can also <a href="mailto:smnookin@mit.edu" target="_blank">email the instructor</a>, assistant professor <a href="http://sethmnookin.com" target="_blank">Seth Mnookin</a>, with any questions.</p>


**Introduction**

The practice and production of journalism is undergoing revolutionary changes. These are the result of a unique convergence of factors, including a societal-wide de-centralization of power, the advent of the Internet, the drying up of traditional revenue sources, and the unprecedented ability of consumers to create information cocoons in which they’re only exposed to viewpoints that confirm their worldviews. Despite the fervent hope of many in the journalism community, these changes are secular and not cyclical: We will never return to an era when a handful of news organizations have the money, the resources, and the reach to dictate what stories the public should consider worthy of its attention.

The diminishment of these traditional gatekeepers has far-reaching consequences. We now have access to more varied types of information, from more diverse sources, than at any other time in history. This presents unique opportunities: We can access newsmakers directly through social media and blogs; we can follow local coverage of events unfolding anywhere in the world; we can undertake civic media projects for stories we feel are not being covered adequately. It also confers exceptional responsibility on us as journalism’s end users. In a world where The New York Times exists in an undifferentiated online landscape with tweets and Facebook updates, being a fully informed member of society is impossible without knowing how to be an intelligent consumer of information.
  
“Topics in 21st Century Journalism” will do exactly that. Through in-depth scrutiny of a range of subjects and modes of practice, the course will give students the tools they need to be actively engaged with their media diets. 

**Course Description**

“Topics in 21st Century Journalism” is comprised of three modular units, each of which is comprised of four class sessions. Each unit will focus on a broad topic area and a distinct methodology, and each unit will require students to write a different type of modern-day news story. The breakdown is as follows:

						Topic area					Methodology					Assignment
						Science 					Long-form					News stories
						Politics					Gonzo journalism			Blog posts
						Arts 						Profiles					Feature stories	
                        



A central component of the course is an online portal, created specifically for the course, which will mimic an online-news site. The portal will be populated with students’ assignments from each of the three units, and students will participate in editorial decisions and back-end maintenance related to the site. The site has been designed using Foundation 4 (foundation.zurb.com) and will be maintained using github and prose.io. Students are not expected to have any previous knowledge with these tools – they will be discussed in the course itself. 

The portal will allow students to experience all aspects of producing a story, from investigation and writing to editing and layout. Students would also be able to “comment” on their classmates’ assignments, mimicking the interactive nature on online news content.


**Assignments and grading**

Class participation will comprise 20 percent of your final grade. Assignments related to the first two units will be worth 25 percent each; assignments related to the final unit will be worth 30 percent. The breakdown is as follows:

<u>Unit 1: Science News Story</u>

- Pitch - 3%
- Lede - 4%
- Rough draft - 7%
- Final draft - 8%

<u>Unit 2: Political blog posts: 25%</u>

- Pitch – 3%
- Blog post 1 – 7%
- Blog post 2 – 7%
- Blog post 3 – 8%	

<u>Unit 3: Art feature story: 30%</u>

- Pitch – 2%
- Outline - 3%
- Rough draft – 7%
- Final draft – 18%

Grades will be assigned according to the following scale:

- A: Consistently excellent work. 
- B: Good, solid work.
- C: Satisfactory but lackluster.
- D: Consistently sub-par work produced with a minimum of effort
- F: Unsatisfactory


**Course policies**

Graduate level credit
Graduate students who want to receive graduate-level credit must contact the instructor to arrange for additional assignments to be completed during the semester.

Attendance/lateness
Attendance is mandatory. Two unexcused absences will result in a reduction of a letter grade for the semester, three unexcused absences will result in the reduction of two letter grades for the semester, and four unexcused absences will result in your being withdrawn from the course. Being more than ten minutes late to class will be considered the equivalent of one-fourth of an unexcused absence.


**MIT Statement on Plagiarism**

Plagiarism — use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgment — is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgment for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available at the Writing and Communication Center and the MIT Website on Plagiarism.
