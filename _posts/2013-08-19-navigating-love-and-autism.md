<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/us/navigating-love-and-autism.html?pagewanted=all">A fascinating <i>New York Times</i> feature</a> explores relationships between people with autism or Asperger's. "The overarching quest of many in this first generation to be identified with Asperger syndrome is the same as many of their nonautistic peers: to find someone to love who will love them back," Harmon writes.
