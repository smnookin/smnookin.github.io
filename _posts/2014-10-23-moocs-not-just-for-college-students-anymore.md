Though not aliens, these Massive Open Online Courses are pretty space age. Thousands of people around the world all watch the same lecture clips and click through the same homework assignments. Right now, many MOOCs are associated with [edX](https://www.edx.org/), a nonprofit started by MIT and Harvard.

EdX, and most MOOCs, are versions of college classes, like those taught at MIT or Harvard. This is cool, in theory, but also problematic - at least, for those who suggest that the future of MOOCs is in completely replacing the residential college experience. As an about-to-graduate MIT senior, some of my best "learning experiences" were in the lab or at my dorm. No online portal can replace that.

I’ve heard plenty of horror stories from friends who took classes that were testing out edX content on the students. While current MIT students may be the perfect guinea pigs, most of us didn’t come here to interact with a computer screen instead of people (okay, some coders might have). We have access to a wealth of brilliant and enthusiastic MIT professors. For those of us who are lucky enough to be here, we should take full advantage of their availability to students. 

But I'm entirely biased as an MIT undergrad. Through MOOCs, students at other colleges also have the chance to take classes like [Science and Cooking](https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-spu27x-science-cooking-haute-639#.VFwgz_TF86A) or [Street-Fighting Math](https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-sfmx-street-fighting-math-1501#.VFwgpPTF86A), which may only exist at places like MIT or Harvard. (I even considered taking "Science and Cooking" through edX last fall!) MOOCs function well as supplements to students who may not otherwise have a chance to study certain subjects; they just can't fully compensate for a residential college education. 

But maybe MOOCs aren't meant to replace college campuses in the first place. A recent _New York Times_ article explained how [the University of Texas system plans to create](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/us/universities-rethinking-their-use-of-massive-online-courses.html?ref=todayspaper&_r=0) a "middle school to medical school" program to coach students over a range of ages on the path towards becoming doctors. Perhaps this is where the future of MOOCs should be focused. People of all ages use the Internet -- not just those interested in taking college-level courses. Why aren't there more diverse offerings for the full range of people out there?

The _Times_ article also mentions the possibility of continuing education classes for professionals (a very small number of these do exist currently in the edX curriculum). This could be expanded; edX or other MOOCs could offer classes in financial planning or other subjects not taught in colleges. There are untraditional, non-academic subjects that many people could benefit from learning in a formal, online course. 

Or, on a more academic level, MOOCs could experiment with different formats for learning languages. Knowing more than one language [can be incredibly beneficial]( http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2014/03/language-study), so many adults regret letting their high school language knowledge just drift away, but how many of these people will actually take a language class at a college somewhere? edX and other MOOCs are trying to revolutionize education formats and make education more accessible, so why not increase people’s ability to communicate? Language learning may not be best suited to a lecture-style format, but classes online aren’t limited to set chunks of lecture each week. The flexibility of the online platform could lead to a more immersive language learning experience, with more small assignments each week. 

In a time of expanding educational horizons, class offerings shouldn’t be limited by trying to imitate college offerings. This isn’t to say that college courses shouldn’t be accessible to more people; I’m very much in favor of increased education. But why stop there?

The world we live in is a complicated place with complicated problems. Trying to understand climate change, respond to outbreaks of disease, or deal with other international issues requires as much education and communication between people and nations as possible. If MOOCs can expand their focus to educate people of all ages about all kinds of topics and languages – not just college students about college class material – maybe they can change the world.
