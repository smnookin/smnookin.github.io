The term 'MOOCs' sounds like it should refer to some hoard of sci-fi creatures. Though not alien creatures, these Massive Open Online Courses are pretty space age. Thousands of people around the world all watch the same lecture clips and click through the same homework assignments. Right now, many MOOCs are associated with [edX](https://www.edx.org/), a nonprofit started by MIT and Harvard.

edX, and most MOOCs, are versions of college classes, like those taught at MIT or Harvard. This is cool, in theory, but also problematic - at least, for those who suggest that the future of MOOCs is in completely replacing the residential college experience. As an about-to-graduate MIT senior, some of my best "learning experiences" were in the lab or at my dorm. No online portal can replace that.

I pretty firmly believe that MOOCs shouldn't replace college campuses. But maybe they're not meant to in the first place.

In [a recent New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/us/universities-rethinking-their-use-of-massive-online-courses.html?ref=todayspaper&_r=0), a different future for edX is mentioned.
