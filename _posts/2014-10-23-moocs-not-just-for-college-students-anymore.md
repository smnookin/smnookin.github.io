The term 'MOOCs' sounds like it should refer to some hoard of sci-fi creatures. Though not alien creatures, these Massive Open Online Courses are pretty space age. Thousands of people around the world all watch the same lecture clips and click through the same homework assignments. Right now, many MOOCs are associated with [edX](https://www.edx.org/), a nonprofit started by MIT and Harvard.

edX, and most MOOCs, are versions of college classes, like those taught at MIT or Harvard. This is cool, in theory, but also problematic - at least, for those who suggest that the future of MOOCs is in completely replacing the residential college experience. As an about-to-graduate MIT senior, some of my best "learning experiences" were in the lab or at my dorm. No online portal can replace that.

I’ve heard plenty of horror stories from friends who took classes that were testing out edX content on the students. While current MIT students may be the perfect guinea pigs, most of us didn’t come here to interact with a computer screen instead of people (okay, some coders might have). We’re among a wealth of brilliant and enthusiastic MIT professors. For those of us who somehow got lucky enough to end up here, we should take full advantage of their availability to students. 

I pretty firmly believe that MOOCs shouldn't replace college campuses. But maybe they're not meant to in the first place.

In [a recent New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/us/universities-rethinking-their-use-of-massive-online-courses.html?ref=todayspaper&_r=0), a different role for MOOCs is suggested. Outside of edX, the U.T. system plans to create a "middle school to medical school" program to coach students over a range of ages towards becoming doctors. This is where the future of MOOCs could be.

Why are MOOCs focused on re-creating college-level classes? People of all ages use the Internet. People of all ages want to learn. Why not educate at more diverse levels?

The NYT article also mentions the possibility of continuing education classes for professionals (a very few of these exist currently in the edX curriculum). This could be expanded; edX or other MOOCs could offer classes in financial planning or other adult-like subjects not taught in colleges. There are untraditional, non-academic subjects that many people could benefit from learning in a formal, online course. 

Or even on a more academic level, MOOCs could experiment with different formats for learning languages. Knowing more than one language [can be incredibly beneficial]( http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2014/03/language-study), and so many adults regret letting their high school language knowledge just drift away, but how many of these people will actually take a language class at a college somewhere? edX and other MOOCs are trying to revolutionize education formats and make education more accessible, so why not increase people’s ability to communicate? Language learning may not be best suited to a lecture-style format, but classes online aren’t limited to chunks of lecture each week. The flexibility of the online platform could lead to a more immersive language learning experience, with more small assignments each week. 

In a time of expanding educational horizons, class offerings shouldn’t be limited by trying to imitate college offerings. This isn’t to say that college courses shouldn’t be accessible to more people; I’m very much in favor of increased education. But why stop there?

The world we live in is a complicated place with complicated problems. Trying to understand climate change, respond to disease outbreak, or deal with other international issues requires as much education and communication between people and nations as possible. If MOOCs can expand their focus to educate people of all ages about all kinds of topics and languages – not just college students about college class material – maybe they can change the world.
