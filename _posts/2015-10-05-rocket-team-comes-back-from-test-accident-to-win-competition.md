On the afternoon of January BLANK, 2015, four undergraduate members of MIT Rocket Team met in the blast chamber of Building 31 to test a prototype of their advanced aerospike nozzle engine. 

The aerospike engine is a rocket engine concept which is capable of operating at maximum aerodynamic efficiency for a wider range of altitudes than a traditional engine. However, there are currently no aerospike engines in commercial production, due to both a lack of research into their design and the fact that they are incredibly difficult to manufacture.

For the past two years, Rocket Team had been working fervently to design and build a small scale aerospike engine, which they planned to launch in summer 2015 at the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition. The aerospike design had proved more challenging than expected, and tensions were high on the team as the project grew further behind schedule. 

“We were really far behind. We were trying to get the engine ready, and since it was the basis of the whole design, we couldn’t make any design decisions. So half the team was stuck without any information, and the engine kept iterating and getting more and more complicated," said Ryan Webb, senior and 2014-2015 Vice President. 

Members of the propulsion team were investigating an ongoing issue with the engine prototype. It was currently unable to sustain a flame inside the engine for longer than a few seconds, and would spray unburnt liquid rocket propellant out of the engine nozzle after the flame went out. In order to successfully launch, the rocket would need to sustain combustion inside the engine for several minutes. The propulsion team had removed the outer cover of the engine, and was trying to determine at what distance from the fuel injector they would observe a sustainable flame. 

Rocket Team had been using the blast chamber, owned by the Gas Turbine Laboratory (GTL), for the past year to perform all of their propulsion testing. Unbeknownst to Rocket Team, the fan in the ventillation shaft of the blast chamber, which was installed in the 1960's, was not rated to the same safety standards as the rest of the chamber.

The propulsion team ignited the aerospike engine, which began to spray a flammable mixture of exhaust gas (burnt propellant) and unburnt propellant into the ventillation shaft. Approximately ten seconds later, they heard a huge bang from above and saw the blast chamber fill with flame. The propellant and exhaust mixture had been ignited in the ventillation shaft by a spark from the fan motor. 

Rocket Team members immediately shut off the test, called the MIT fire deparment, and performed a safety checklist to vent the blast chamber of any potentially flammable or hazardous chemicals. Later that day, they were contacted by the Aero/Astro department facilities manager, Anthony Zolenik, who was investigating the accident. It was the beginning of a very tense period of time between the Aero/Astro department and Rocket Team, which called all aspects of the team's safety practices and its continued existence into question. 

Prior to the testing incident, Rocket Team was performing propulsion tests “almost daily. We were trying to speed up engine development… we were given a lot of autonomy over testing,” said Webb. 



What does it take for a group of college students to bring 10 lbs. of payload to 10,000 feet altitude? In January, the MIT Rocket Team experienced a testing accident that nearly brought the team to an end. After making several hard decisions, including choosing to completely redesign their rocket concept, the team was able to come back and win the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition in June. Rocket Team leadership says the team is stronger than ever and preparing to compete again next summer.

According to Rocket Team Vice President Ryan Webb (MIT ‘16), the root cause of the pressure loss which caused the accident is still unknown. 

After the accident, the MIT Aero/Astro deparment leadership required that Rocket Team “come up with a comprehensive safety plan that EHS [Engineering Health and Safety] would approve,” said Webb.

The new safety plan, written by Webb, requires a test plan to be created and approved prior to each propulsion test. According to Webb, “It’s a lot of stuff we were already doing, but formally written down.” The test plans are approved by the Rocket Team faculty advisor, Professor Lozano, and Aero/Astro department leadership.

Prior to the testing incident, Rocket Team was performing propulsion tests “almost daily. We were trying to speed up engine development… we were given a lot of autonomy over testing. [Our faculty advisor] knew we were continuously doing stuff, but apparently that wasn’t clear to the rest of the GTL staff,” said Webb. 

Tensions were high on Rocket Team prior to the accident due to the slow development of the aerospike engine design. “We were really far behind. We were trying to get the engine ready, and since it was the basis of the whole design, we couldn’t make any design decisions. So half the team was just kind of stuck without any information, and the engine kept iterating and getting more and more complicated, and fewer people were being involved,” said Webb.

After the accident, the Rocket Team president, Julia Crowly-Farenga, and Webb realized they would have to make a major change in order to be able to compete in June. They first had to convince the designers of the aerospike nozzle. 

The aerospike engine is a rocket engine concept in which the exhaust gases flow around a protruding spike, rather than inside a traditional bell nozzle. An aerospike nozzle is capable of operating at its maximum aerodynamic efficiency at a wider range of altitudes than a bell nozzle, because the exhaust exit area is not physically constrained.

However, there are currently no aerospike nozzles in commercial production. According to Webb, “they’ve never really had a good flight record because they’re hard to manufacture. Us being MIT, we wanted to do the hardest thing we could think of.” 
 
(Possibly add some information in here from the Matt V interview about how he and James Logan brought rocket team back to life -- in 2012 they were the only two people on it, were both sophomores, and that’s when they decided to pursue aerospike design and also recruit more people to the team)

“We were going to tell them that their baby was dead, basically, that they’d been working on for two years,” said Webb. “I was really worried, but Matt said it was the most logical way to move forward. I was pretty relieved when he said that.” 

Rocket Team immediately turned to building a more conventional rocket, using an off-the-shelf solid rocket engine. 
Webb said he noticed a change in the team attitude after the work on the new rocket design started. “Within the team, it was a lot better. Every week we were accomplishing a lot of stuff. I think more people got involved in doing things and learning stuff. Even freshmen were, you know, getting really into packing the parachutes. I think there was just a lot more for people to do,” he said. 

“Before we were trying to focus on something really technically hard,” said Webb, “but I think it’s more valuable to actually build something slightly simpler and make it work well. I think it helped the team get a sense of real engineering, actually building something. I’m pretty proud of how we came out with it.” 

(Add some perspectives from Eric R here, the current president of Rocket Team. He was just a Rocket Team member last year -- not leadership -- so see how it was different for him before/after design change)

In June 2015, the MIT Rocket Team won the basic rocket category at the IREC in Green River, Utah. The basic rocket category requires a 10lb payload be sent to 10,000 ft. Rocket Team reached an altitude of 9,690 ft and were awarded additional points for successful rocket recovery and payload deployment, leading them to win their division. 

Rocket Team plans to compete in the basic category again this summer, but use fewer commercial parts and more of their own hardware. The advanced category requires all rocket parts be manufactured by the team itself, and raises the altitude to 25,000 ft. 

“Instead of jumping right to that, we’re trying to do the basic rocket again and practice with those [building] techniques and get those skills on the team, so if we decided to do the advanced, it’s just scaling those things up,” said Webb.
