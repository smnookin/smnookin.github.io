On a January afternoon in 2015, four members of MIT Rocket Team met in the blast chamber of Building 31 to test a prototype of their advanced aerospike engine. 

The aerospike engine is a rocket engine design that operates at maximum aerodynamic efficiency for a wider range of altitudes than a traditional engine. However, there are no aerospike engines in commercial production, due to both a lack of research into their design and the fact that they are incredibly difficult to manufacture.

For the past two years, Rocket Team had been working fervently to design and build an aerospike engine, which they planned to launch in summer 2015 at the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition. The aerospike design had proved more challenging than expected, and everyday they fell further behind schedule, the tension increased. 

The propulsion team ignited the engine to begin a propulsion test. After about ten seconds of operation, they heard a large bang and the inside of the blast chamber was filled with a fiery explosion. 

Rocket Team members immediately shut off the engine, called the MIT Fire Department, and vented the blast chamber of any hazardous gases. After the Fire Department declared the chamber safe to enter, the students took pictures of the remnants of their engine. They needed to find out if a flaw in their engine design had caused the explosion. 

The propulsion team had been investigating an ongoing issue with the engine. It was currently unable to sustain a flame inside the engine for longer than a few seconds. In order to successfully launch, the rocket would need to sustain combustion for several minutes. 

“We were trying to get the engine ready, and since it was the basis of the whole design, we couldn’t make any design decisions. So half the team was stuck without any information, and the engine kept iterating and getting more and more complicated," said Ryan Webb, 2014-2015 Rocket Team Vice President. 

Shortly after the explosion occured, Rocket Team was contacted by the facilities manager, Anthony Zolenik, who was investigating the accident. He also had some information about the cause of the accident. The fan in the ventilation shaft of the blast chamber, which was installed in the 1960's, was not rated to the same safety standards as the rest of the chamber.

During testing, the engine sprayed flammable gas into the ventilation shaft. A spark from the fan motor ignited the gas inside the ventilation shaft, causing an explosion that travelled down into the chamber. 

The explosion also destroyed the fan, rendering the blast chamber unusable until it could be replaced. Rocket Team had used the blast chamber, owned by the Gas Turbine Laboratory (GTL), for the past year to perform propulsion testing. Now, they had no working engine, and nowhere to test. 

Although Rocket Team was not responsible for the cause of the accident, the accident caused the Aero/Astro department to question some of the team's safety practices. 

The tension between Rocket Team and the department arose from a miscommunication about who the team was supposed to notify prior to conducting tests. Rocket Team was under the impression they only needed to notify the GTL technician in charge of the blast chamber, but members of the Aero/Astro department felt more oversight was needed. 

Before the testing incident, “We were given a lot of autonomy. [Our faculty advisor, Professor Lozano] knew we were continuously doing stuff, but apparently that wasn't clear to the rest of the GTL staff,” said Webb. 

"We were doing a rocket engine test. There was a small explosion. That's to be expected when you're doing a rocket engine test, that's why we're doing this in a blast chamber," said propulsion lead Matt Vernacchia of the reaction to the incident.

Department leadership required Rocket Team write a safety plan and have it approved by Engineering Health and Safety (EHS). “It’s a lot of stuff we were already doing, but formally written down," said Webb.  

Safety procedures are "an ongoing conversation right now," according to team president, Eric Riehl. "I don't think we've come yet to a point where we're both clear on what the safety protocol should be for our team," he said. 

"Everything became a safety concern all of a sudden. We're not even sure whether or not we can buy power tools right now," Riehl added. 

Rocket Team leadership also realized they had to make a major design change in order to compete in June. They had to convince the designers of the aerospike to drop the design in favor of something simpler. 

“We were going to tell them that their baby was dead, basically, that they’d been working on for two years,” said Webb.

Three seniors on the team, including Vernacchia, had been working on the aerospike since the summer after their sophomore year, when they were the only three students on the team.The three recruited tirelessly that fall and grew the team to over twenty students. 

As the team grew, new members needed to be brought up to speed. At the same time, the aerospike engine development became increasingly complicated. 

"We were so rushed to get the project to work and working so much at the limits of our understanding that we sometimes chose to do things ourselves rather than teaching people on the project how to do them... A lot of manpower felt bored and wasn't doing anything" said Vernacchia. 

The decision to change designs made sense to the aerospike designers.

“Once this forced us to take a step back... we realized we were being too ambitious and it wasn't going to be realistic,” said Vernacchia. “We were in this mindset of wanting to make this big contribution, but we should have realized the purpose of the team is educational." 

Rocket Team swapped the aerospike for a more conventional, off-the-shelf solid rocket engine. Changing designs so close to the competition presented new challenges for the team. 

"You would think that because we won first that we did really well. But the reality was that it was pretty unorganized," Riehl said. 

Rocket Team suffered two more setbacks before their winning launch. During a test flight in May, the parachute failed to deploy and the rocket body was obliterated and had to be completely rebuilt. On the first day of the competition in June, the payload module broke while being attached to the rocket. 

After repairing the payload module overnight, Rocket Team launched successfully the next day to win the basic rocket category. The basic category requires a 10lb payload be sent to 10,000 ft. Rocket Team reached an altitude of 9,690 ft and were awarded additional points for their payload design. 

The team plans to compete in the basic category again next summer, but use fewer commercial parts and more of their own hardware. The advanced category does not allow any commercial parts be used, and raises the altitude to 25,000 ft. 

“Instead of jumping right to that, we’re trying to do the basic rocket again and practice with those techniques and get those skills on the team,” said Webb. 

Riehl wants to see the design process improved within the team and work out remaining tensions with the department.

"The whole goal for this year is very thorough engineering... We want to make sure we do things the right way. We want to represent the department well," Riehl said.
