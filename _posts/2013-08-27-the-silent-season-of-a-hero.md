Joe Dimaggio is a baseball legend, both for his record career with the New York Yankees and his high-profile relationship with actrees Marilyn Monroe. A feature on the famous athlete, published in _Esquire_, explores the fleeting nature of fame. "And so the baseball hero must always act the part, must preserve the myth, and none does it better than DiMaggio."
