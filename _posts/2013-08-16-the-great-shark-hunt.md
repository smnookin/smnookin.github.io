![](http://sethmnookin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HST-edited-2.png) Thompson's gonzo masterpiece was published in _Playboy_'s December 1973 issue, on the heels of his two best-known books: 1972's _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ and 1973's _Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, 1972_. The story also lent its name to the first book-length collection of Thompson's work, which came out in 1979.
