My name is 美亜 (Mia). In Japanese, 美 means American and 亜 means Asia. My parents chose these characters because my mother is Japanese and my father is American. But my interest in these two countries goes beyond my name. I’m also very interested in US-Japan relations.

Earlier this month I attended the US-Japan Council Conference hosted by the US-Japan council (USJC) in Washington D.C. USJC is a non-profit organization that strives to strengthen US-Japan relations. The theme for this year’s conference was Risk, Reward, and Innovation: Opportunities for the United States and Japan”. 

Though the relationship between the US and Japan tend to be strong, Japan’s slowing economy and a “pivot to Asia” has increased interest in other East Asian countries, but has consequently decreased interest in Japan. 

In 2009, the number of Japanese students studying in America was less than half of what it was in 2000 and continued to fall until recently . Finally, the number of Japanese students studying abroad has increased. However, relative to students from other East Asian countries the number of Japanese students studying abroad is still very low. This is a problem for Japan. The Japanese firms will suffer if Japanese companies don’t globalize.  Japan needs global leaders who can speak English, function in a global environment, and take initiative and leadership-- studying abroad could help them achieve those goals.

Growing up in both Japan and America, attending typical American and Japanese schools, and interacting with friends from both countries, I can personally say that Japan is a really cool place. Most Americans visit Japan for the anime, the pop culture, the fashion and the music, but for me, Japan is so much more than that. 

There’s the efficiency — train operators are remarkably on time and apologize if they run a mere 30 seconds late. 

There’s the attention to detail — the end of the toilet paper roll at the public restroom neatly tucked into a triangle, the sunflower intentionally placed diagonally to give off the notion of imperfection in a flower arrangement, a chocolate chip cookie from a local cafe wrapped inside a plastic bag with a thin ribbon.

Through my everyday interactions, I have found that typically the people are kind and considerate—if you forget your wallet in a taxi, someone will most likely deliver it back to your home. 

Rich history is everywhere — if you turn onto any unassuming side street, the hustle and bustle of the city fades away, and you might find a Buddhist monk in his traditional clothing walking into a 300-year-old temple.

And of course, the food is the best of the best.  Japan has more Michelin three-starred restaurants then in any other country in the world. Even a one-dollar box of fried chicken from a convenience store is delicious. 

I want to increase interest in Japan especially amongst Americans. I want them to think that it’s a cool place to work and live, and based on my experience at the US-Japan Council Conference, so do a lot of people. 


Attendees discussed Japan’s economy and civil sector, corporate leadership and a number of bilateral issues, including clean energy and technology, the changing face of communication, and global youth education. 

The conference featured several prominent figures in US-Japan relations. John Strangfeld, the chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial, Inc., discussed the firms’ journey to establish a strong presence in Japan. He concluded his speech saying, “Prudential is a better company as a result of what we have learned from Japan”. Dr. Shinya Yamanaka, a Nobel Prize Winner in physiology believes that “both countries [the US and Japan] need to nurture strong ties to accelerate the speed of research, for the benefit of the many people with intractable diseases around the world.” These are examples of speakers and presenters out of many who spoke on the future of US-Japan relations. 

As a college student, I’m in a unique position to strengthen US-Japan relations among the youth who will one day sh¬¬ape the relationship between these two great countries. 

It’s important for Japanese students to learn English, develop leadership skills, and learn to take initiative. For Americans, it’s important to make sure Japan is on their mind. The TOMODACHI Initiative does just that. The TOMODACHI Initiative is a non-profit hosted by USJC that strives to foster US-Japanese relations through education, cultural exchanges, and entrepreneurial and leadership programs. At the conference I met an American student who participated in a TOMDOACHI program. This particular program brought together twenty students from Japan with 20 students from Washington D.C. The student that I met said that by interacting with these Japanese students he learned to embrace Japanese culture, and is extremely excited to visit Japan in November. 

During those few days I spent in D.C., the passion for US-Japanese relations shared by the conference participants motivated me to create a network of students who are interested in Japan and develop programs to attract others.
