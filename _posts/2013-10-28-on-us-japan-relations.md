My name is 美亜 (Mia). In Japanese, 美 means America and 亜 means Asia. My parents chose these characters because my mother is Japanese and my father is American. But my interest in these two countries goes beyond my name and heritage. I want to be part of a generation that cultivates a strong relationship between the two countries, and I  think that our generation, as students, can key role in the future of this relationship for decades to come. 

With Chinese power on the rise, I think that important for the US and Japan to maintain this strong relationship. WHY?  
For these reaons, It’s important for Japanese students to learn English, develop leadership skills, and learn to take initiative. For Americans, it’s important to make sure Japan contniues to be its top ally, despite the rise of other East Asian countires.

In 2009, the number of Japanese students studying in America was less than half of what it was in 2000 and continued to fall until recently . Finally, the number of Japanese students studying abroad has increased. However, relative to students from other East Asian countries the number of Japanese students studying abroad is still very low. This is a problem for Japan. The Japanese firms will suffer if Japanese companies don’t globalize.  Japan needs global leaders who can speak English, function in a global environment, and take initiative and leadership--studying abroad could help them achieve those goals.

IN America..... 

Earlier this month I attended a conference hosted by the US-Japan council (USJC) in Washington D.C., heavily discussed the necessities and ways  the two countires can remain strengthen relationship between the two countires.

Though the relationship between the US and Japan tend to be strong, Japan’s slowing economy and a “pivot to Asia” has increased interest in other East Asian countries, but has consequently decreased interest in Japan. 





The conference featured several prominent figures in US-Japan relations. John Strangfeld, the chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial, Inc., discussed the firms’ journey to establish a strong presence in Japan. He concluded his speech saying, “Prudential is a better company as a result of what we have learned from Japan”. Dr. Shinya Yamanaka, a Nobel Prize Winner in physiology believes that “both countries [the US and Japan] need to nurture strong ties to accelerate the speed of research, for the benefit of the many people with intractable diseases around the world.” These are examples of speakers and presenters out of many who spoke on the future of US-Japan relations. 

As a college student, I’m in a unique position to strengthen US-Japan relations among the youth who will one day shape the relationship between these two great countries. 

It’s important for Japanese students to learn English, develop leadership skills, and learn to take initiative. For Americans, it’s important to make sure Japan is on their mind. The TOMODACHI Initiative does just that. The TOMODACHI Initiative is a non-profit hosted by USJC that strives to foster US-Japanese relations through education, cultural exchanges, and entrepreneurial and leadership programs. At the conference I met an American student who participated in a TOMODACHI program. This particular program brought together twenty students from Japan with 20 students from Washington D.C. The student that I met said that by interacting with these Japanese students he learned to embrace Japanese culture, and is extremely excited to visit Japan in November. 

During those few days I spent in D.C., the passion for US-Japanese relations shared by the conference participants motivated me to create a network of students who are interested in Japan and develop programs to attract others.
