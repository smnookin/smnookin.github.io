My name is 美亜 (Mia). In Japanese, 美 means America and 亜 means Asia. My parents chose these characters because my mother is Japanese and my father is American. But my interest in these two countries goes beyond my name and heritage. I want to be part of a generation that cultivates a strong relationship between the two countries, and I think that our generation, as students, can key role in the future of this relationship for decades to come. 

I think that it's important for the US and Japan to maintain this important relationship. Hilary Clinton stated that the U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of [America's] engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. and Japan have worked together on bilateral defense and security issues including stopping proliferation in North Korea and on facilitating a peace rise of China as their economy grows. The U.S. and Japan account for over 30% of world domestic product, [according to William Cooper from the Congressional Research Service](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33436.pdf). The alliance between the U.S. and Japan is clearly significant. However, it's the people-to-people connection, the understanding of each other's countries cultures and people that make this relationship meaningful and sustainable. 

In 2009,however, the number of Japanese students studying in America was less than half of what it was in 2000 and continued to fall until recently. Finally, the number of Japanese students studying abroad has increased. However, relative to students from other East Asian countries the number of Japanese students studying abroad is still very low. This is a problem for Japan. The Japanese firms will suffer if Japanese companies don’t globalize.  Japan needs global leaders who can speak English, function in a global environment, and take initiative and leadership--studying abroad could help them achieve those goals. On the contrary, in 1997, Japan was the number one destination for American students, [according to William Burns](http://www.implu.com/government_news/473/300436). Now, Japan ranks sixth. 

Earlier this month I attended a conference hosted by the US-Japan council (USJC) in Washington D.C. USJC aims to cultivate this relationship through people to people interactions, and the conference focused heavily on how the two countries can maintain a sustainable, strong relationship. The conference featured several prominent figures in US-Japan relations. John Strangfeld, the chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial, Inc., discussed the firms’ journey to establish a strong presence in Japan. He concluded his speech saying, “Prudential is a better company as a result of what we have learned from Japan.”Dr. Shinya Yamanaka, a Nobel Prize Winner in physiology believes that “both countries [the US and Japan] need to nurture strong ties to accelerate the speed of research, for the benefit of the many people with intractable diseases around the world.” These are examples of speakers and presenters out of many who spoke on the future of US-Japan relations. 

The conference also highlighted the importance of cultivating the younger generations to strengthen this relationship. As a college student I was encouraged because I’m in a unique position to strengthen US-Japan relations among the youth who will one day shape the relationship between these two great countries. This summer, I interned for an organization supported by USJC called the TOMODACHI Initiative, which strives to do just that. It aims to foster US-Japanese relations through education, cultural exchanges, and entrepreneurial and leadership programs for young Americans and Japanese. 

At the conference I met an American student who participated in a TOMODACHI program. This particular program brought together twenty students from Japan with twenty students from Washington D.C. The student that I met said that by interacting with these Japanese students he learned to embrace Japanese culture, and is extremely excited to visit Japan in November. 

During those few days I spent in D.C., the passion for US-Japanese relations shared by the conference participants motivated me to create a network of students who are interested in Japan and develop programs to attract others.
