Stu or Stephen? Stuphen?

Stu Schmill is a nerd. I say this as the utmost compliment. Frameless rectangular glasses perch on his nose beneath dark, thick, active eyebrows that bounce and jump on his forehead like electrons in an excited state. A grey striped suit and blue tie hang on his slight frame. It is his unassuming stature, packed dense with a buzzing energy, the glasses, and his peppered black hair that have caused many to tell Schmill, an MIT alumnus and the current Dean of Admissions, that he reminds them of Stephen Colbert. “I myself never would have made that comparison, but I decided to go with it,” he says. “Now every year at the beginning of admissions season I do one of those ‘The Word’ segments” similar to what’s on The Colbert Report.” 

Two of Schmill’s favorite admissions jokes go:
“Admissions officers have told students and parents that we like students who do community service, and so almost all of our applicants have now done community service… so we must speak carefully. We love students who can bake cookies!”

In 2012, MIT’s admissions team decided to play up the Stu-Stephen comparison even more: That was the year they created a response to a Colbert Report segment that mocked MIT by comparing it to a higher end training school.

Richard Hersh was on the Colbert Report in April of 2012 to talk about the state of education in the US. He mentioned that MIT was an example of universities who were doing higher education correctly. Colbert, in his character’s signature feigned ignorance, said, “MIT? That’s just a tech school. It’s basically the Harvard of DeVrys.”

The response video, titled “Stu Puts Stephen on Notice” shows Schmill watching the clip on a massive mounted monitor from behind his desk in the admissions office. When its done, Schmill slowly swivels to face the camera, leaving time for the camera to zoom in on Stu’s MIT’s iconic class ring, the Brass Rat. 

“Hello, Stephen,” he says. “I’m Stu Schmill.

  
Wait, which one is Stu…and which one is Stephen…

“It is clear that you have a lot to learn about MIT…Which brings us to tonight’s Word: Education”

Schmill, emulates the Colbert cadence and tone with ease, defends MIT’s nerdy honor. “You may call us just a tech school or, The Harvard of DeVrys,” Stu said, “Big words coming from the Jon Stewart of DeVry’s.” The joke doesn’t make much sense, but it’s the sentiment that counts. Now he’s on a roll, telling Colbert that if he were to apply to MIT, his application would make a worthy contender… for his shredder. 

“My favorite joke from that video was when we pulled up ‘MIT nation > Colbert Nation’ on the screen,’” said Stu. “Colbert himself is a genius, and I am obviously not even in the same ballpark as him – but that’s the kind of humor I like.”

Chris Peterson, an assistant director in the Admissions Office, is the one who pitched the video as a way to bring attention to MIT’s Admissions Blog. “A lot of admissions deans wouldn’t go for it because it would make them look foolish,” he says – but Schmill was immediately enthusiastic. The video, he says, is just one more way the office can show prospective students that “we care and we have a human.” Schmill is so turned off by pomp and circumstance that, Peterson says, he doesn’t even like it when people address him by his formal title.

Stu Schmill, a History

Stu’s path to Dean of admissions looks more like the back of a circuit board, with dead ends and 90 degree turns, than the simple or straight trajectory experienced by most in the admissions world. 

Stu grew up as an only child in a small apartment in the park section of Queens, New York. He studied Course 2, nerd-speak for mechanical engineering, at MIT. There he lived in an on-campus dorm, New House, and was a coxswain on the crew team. 

After graduating from MIT, Stu moved to Detroit to work for General Motors as an engineer. which required him to organize people to ensure that individual parts were made so that they would eventually fit together. He was both relieved, but also seemed slightly disappointed, to not have to face any more free body diagrams (a common analytical tool for any mechanical engineer). 

To make more friends and meet people in his new city, he began coaching high school students for crew. At the National Championships, Stu bumped into his old MIT coach; not long after that, he got a call asking if he would be interested in coming back to MIT to coach freshmen crew. “At first I laughed and said, ‘Oh I would love to, but I live in Detroit and I have a job,’” he said. “Then I thought about it. I was 22, and if ever I was going make a move like this now would be the time.”

Three years later, Stu was named the director of the MIT boathouse. When his daughter was born, he realized that coaching was keeping him from his family. When a fundraising job opened up in the Alumni Office, Stu decided to go for it. After filling that role for two and a half years, Stu moved to the admissions office to run the Alumni Interviewing Program. 

At the time, Marilee Jones was dean of MIT admissions, a position she had held for 10. Then, it was revealed that she fabricated credentials on her résumé28 years earlier and had not corrected her misrepresentation on future job applications. When Jones was forced to resign, Stu was appointed interim dean. “The hardest part was trying to help the admission office go forward when we lost someone we had loved and then was just abruptly taken away,” Schmill said. “It was awkward because I was interim while also applying for the job. I developed a much deeper appreciation for students waiting to get in or not because I was waiting to hear what would ultimately happen.”

‘Stu’dent 

Stu wasn’t always the bespectacled shepherd of nerds he is today. As a kid, Stu seemed more on the path to being a jock than a science geek, playing stickball and paddleball with the other kids before moving on to golf, tennis, and Little League. Math and science were always among Stu’s strengths, but they didn’t become a passion until a 9th grade trip to the Museum of Natural History opened his eyes to “slimy insects and creatures” and other mysteries of the scientific world.

His interest in these subjects caused him to focus on “sciencey” schools when he applied to college. His parents, who hadn’t attended college, left him to his own devices when looking at schools. The man who would one day lead MIT’s admissions doesn’t actually remember how he first heard about MIT or what his views on the school were before he applied. “I remember being quite shocked that I got in,” he says. “I applied, just like if you walk by a slot machine and toss a coin in. I honestly had no idea. I just thought I was doing fine in school.”

Once on campus, Stu didn’t exactly fall in love with MIT as an institution. “MIT was a shock,” he says. “It didn’t happen very often in high school where they’d go through things I didn’t understand. So that MIT student experience, where you have to say I don’t get this and I need help, was definitely terrifying for me.” He relates to the feelings of inadequacy that many MIT students feel once they arrive. MIT was meant for the insanely smart, the gods of geekdom. “Academics wise I did ok. I did fine,” Stu said. “Most of the energy that comes back to you when you commit to things came from my teammates at the boathouse and my living group more so than my actual classes.” 

Stu and his friends probably never would have guessed he would go on to be such an essential part of the MIT administration. At the time, there was less institutionalized student support to ensure that once admitted, people were able to succeed. The administration also didn’t send the message that they were concerned about students’ happiness and well-being. A popular phrase used around MIT today is “IHTFP”, which represents the love/hate relationship students have with the Institute. It can be interpreted to stand for “I have truly found paradise,” or “I hate this fucking place.” According to Stu, this phrase didn’t exist when he was an undergrad because no one saw MIT as a paradise.  

“IHTFP back then would have been much more skewed to the hate side.”

Dean Stu

These days, it’s nearly impossible to get Stu to talk about anything other than how much he loves MIT and it’s students. Even when I try to get Stu to talk about himself, he always manages to steer the conversation back to MIT or to admissions. This is probably due to the fact that they are in the peak of application reading season, making critical admissions decisions before early action acceptance letters go out in a few weeks. I half expected him to break into the pitch designed to lure glassy eyed high school student to apply to MIT, even though I am already a student there. The pitch convinced me long ago.

Stu likes to do the whole dean thing a little differently. “I am a relative late comer to the admissions world. Before I applied for this job I only had 5 years of experience. People who have worked as admissions counselors for decades probably feel more traditional about the mechanics of admissions, whereas I don’t feel as beholden to those traditions. We are going to do not what has been done in the past, but what makes sense to us. For example we don’t use the common app, but most selective schools use it,” said Stu.

I can speak to Stu’s unconventional dean-ness anecdotally. I was accepted to a couple schools that are about the same level academically as MIT, and I attended their campus preview weekends, where admitted students spend the weekend at the school to meet other admitted students and taste that school’s experience. From all the campus preview weekends I went to, the only speaker I remember was Stu. In the opening speech, he joked, “As dean of admissions, I don’t think I would have admitted me.” Stu was also the only dean of admissions who actually spoke to the admitted class at the preview weekend.

Speeches seem to be Stu’s forte. As colleagues, Peterson gets to witness firsthand a lot of Stu’s on stage antics: “He presented an award at the FIRST Robotics Competition. Before him, it was all these corporate drones, like the VPs at Anonymous Large Tech Company reading straight off of a script. No connection with the audience. But Stu got up in jeans and stood up in front of about 50,000 people and FIRST Robotics kids and just organically went, ‘MY PEOPLE!’ with his arms outstretched like he was the Moses of nerds…and the crowd just went nuts.” 

He stays involved with students even after their applications have been through his office. He writes blogs (thought not as often as he would like) addressed to students who weren’t admitted, reassuring them that even if they were disappointed, they were great applicants[http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/reflections]. He told MIT’s newspaper, The Tech, his advice to students on how to work through self-doubt when they are struggling with their classes [http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N59/schmill.html]. “I think you could see it in the fact that he is a freshman advisor. In every case that I can think of where he became aware that one of our student bloggers was having a hard time, he cared a lot,” said Peterson. You can really tell that Stu gets the most excited now when he talks about students because his animated eyebrows, which jumped and giggled when he talked about his friendships on crew and in New House, nearly hit the ceiling.

According to Peterson, Stu sees his work as highly important profession morally, as opposed to just another job. One thing that he has changed about MIT admissions is reducing the names they buy from the College Board. All universities go to the College Board with ranges of test scores, then buy a certain number of names within that range so that they can send materials to encourage them to apply. Most colleges want to attract the widest range possible to keep their acceptance rates low to appear more selective and desirable. “We have actually pulled back on the amount of names we buy because we don’t want to attract students that we don’t think have a chance of being accepted and doing well here. Stu has essentially said we could easily drive up our applications by 50% and look like great recruiters, but we don’t want to create more misery in the world by rejecting more people just to keep our metrics good,” said Peterson, who later compared Stu to a moral North Star.

The Stu Crew

In how he approaches being a boss, Stu relies on his experiences at GM and as a crew coach, doing his best to bring out the best in the people around him. “He does it better than anyone I’ve ever worked with. He’s really respected not only by people in our office, but among deans of admission and peers and counterparts. It’s not uncommon to go to one of these admissions conferences and to hear people say ‘well if I could work for any admission dean I would work for Stu.’ I think he really inspires through a variety of interpersonal characteristics that bring out this kind of loyalty. He really gets the most out of people he works with. I don’t know how he does it,” said Peterson. Stu describes his talents a little differently, saying, “I realize its not what I do that really matters, it’s the people around me and the best that I can do is assemble the good people around me. Things are going to work better when that happens. Maybe I’m not doing nothing but generally my attitude is not to try to do things that others can do better, but to help and motivate them to do the best that they can.”

Looking forward

Stu will once again be faced with the other side of admissions. His daughters are  approaching the college process. On his admissions blog bio, he wrote that they were prospective members of the class of 2022 and 2024. “Now that its getting close enough I’ve got to take that off,” he said when I asked him if that was still in the cards. “When they were little it was funny, but my oldest is in high school. The odds that they will make it into MIT are low just because they are for everyone, you know? I don’t want them to have that kind of pressure. The problem is MIT is the only school they ever hear about.” His voice breaks a little when he says, “I used to tell them growing up all the things that we look for: work hard and this and that. Finally, years ago, my youngest said to me, “Dad stop you’re putting too much pressure on me! I’m just a kid. I hope you’ll still love me even if I’m not perfect. And that took me, so I stopped. Now I don’t talk to them about college at all. I don’t push them on activities or anything.” However, even admissions deans have protective dad instincts that kick in. “Sometimes I worry, because I’m like what are you guys doing? You’re just sitting around playing video games. I think, “oh, you could be doing something! You could read a book!” But I’m sure I wasted a lot of time as a kid too. It is a hard balance because you do want to encourage them and push them a little bit.”

As for doing college tours elsewhere, Stu will be going incognito. “I’ll have to hide myself behind some sunglasses so it’s going be a little weird.” I suggest he disguise himself as a certain news comedy show host.

Speaking of Colbert, 2 years later and he still has not responded to the admissions video. I take that to mean he admits defeat to the Moses of Nerds.
