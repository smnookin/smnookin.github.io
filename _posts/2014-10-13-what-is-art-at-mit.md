But over 1000 MIT students did exactly that at the [List Visual Arts Center’s Student Loan Art Program](https://listart.mit.edu/events-programs/student-loan-art-program-artwork-pickup) in September. Nearly 600 of them got lucky in the lottery and were able to take home a piece of art for the academic year. 

These lucky 600 are able to live with art for a year, but those who didn’t win the lottery don’t have to resign themselves to art-less existences. MIT’s campus is full of public art, in and out of buildings, but many people aren’t aware of the extent of the collection. 

Maybe lack of awareness isn’t the biggest limiting factor in people’s interactions with art at MIT. After all, some pieces are pretty hard to miss. The Sol LeWitt piece “Bars of Color Within Squares (MIT)” is literally walked on or past by much of the MIT community each day – the bright colors cover the floor around building 6C (right near MIT’s major hallway).

But some pieces may be less obvious to a passerby; Anish Kapoor’s curved steel “Non-Object (Plane)” in the Stata Center may be mistaken for another quirky feature of the oddly designed Frank Gehry building. The funhouse-mirror-like piece was designed to interact with in a space full of colors, odd angles, and weird sources of light from the pointy glass entrances to the space. But most people just walk past the piece. Do they think of it as part of the architecture? Is there a distinction between architecture and art?

MIT may be the perfect place to consider the overlap between architecture and art. To put it diplomatically, MIT doesn’t have a traditional college campus feel of idyllic, identical brick buildings. The architecture here is a bit...different. From Gehry’s Dr. Seuss-like Stata Center to Steven Holl’s futuristic sponge of a dormitory, Simmons Hall, MIT’s buildings attract as much attention from tourists as the academics of the school, if not more (1). But are they considered art by MIT's inhabitants?

Living with art and living within art are very different things. Presumably no one who lives in Simmons or works in the Stata Center wakes up every day excited about the art in which they live or work. Excitement wears off. We become jaded. Our environments become background to us, filtered out as we process other, more relevant information. MIT is a busy place; the average undergrad stressing about psets and tests and research may not have enough time to wander around and enjoy the art around her.

Or, she may choose to do her exploration at night. MIT’s underground (both literally and figuratively) hacking community may know the campus better than anyone. By exploring, understanding, and creatively adding to their environment, hackers at MIT over its history have contributed more pieces of public interest than any commissioned artist.

Classifying hacks as art may seem like a stretch. Does turning the tallest building on campus into a giant game of Tetris count? Public interaction with the piece was high, but its reflection of culture may be low. But what about turning MIT’s main entrance, Lobby 7, into a cathedral and hosting a wedding there? The Cathedral of Our Lady of the All-Night Tool, as it was called, might be more reflective of many students’ beliefs than any single religiously-affiliated building. Hacking at MIT showcases the creativity and curiosity of MIT students in ways they may not explore in any class or lab. 

Not every MIT undergrad may pay much attention to the official public art around them or the famous architecture they live and work in, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t interact with their environment. Like any other discussion of MIT students, exploration of art is different for each individual. Whether living with a painting on loan from the List, exploring or enjoying public art all around campus, or adding to the unexpectedness of campus structures via hacks, many MIT students find ways to interact with art in their environment.
