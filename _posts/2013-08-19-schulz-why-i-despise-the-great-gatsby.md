_New York_ magazine's book critic reveals <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2013/05/schulz-on-the-great-gatsby.html">her distate for F. Scott Fitzgerald's _The Great Gatsby_</a> just as the Baz Luhrmann big screen adaptation brought the novel a new wave of attention. "_Gatsby_ as a literary creation leaves me cold," Schulz wrote. "Like one of those manicured European parks patrolled on all sides by officious gendarmes, it is pleasant to look at, but you will not find any people inside."
