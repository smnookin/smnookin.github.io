Suzanne Corkin has the bright corner office you’d expect of a distinguished senior faculty member at an elite university. It’s on the fifth floor of the Brain and Cognitive Sciences building on MIT’s campus, and the walls are mostly window. There’s a rubber chew toy on the floor, courtesy of the other inhabitant of the office: Trooper, Corkin’s mottled brown dog. On the bookshelf is a framed collage of pictures of Henry Molaison, the famous amnesic (known until his death in 2008 as HM), whose brain Corkin has studied for the past five decades. There’s also a pink hat painted to look like a brain, hanging on a coat rack. “Nice thinking cap,” I say.

“Do you want to keep it?” she answers.

Corkin is a Professor Emerita in Behavioral Neuroscience at MIT. She’s done five decades of groundbreaking research on HM, one of the most famous patients in modern neuroscience. Though she officially retired in 2012, she considers it more important than ever that she continue to teach and promote women in science. 

“Everybody wants to make some sort of contribution to the world,” she says. “I don’t feel like I’ve made such a gigantic one.”

### 'Prepare, prepare, prepare'

Corkin was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and studied clinical psychology as an undergraduate at Smith College, an all-women’s school in Northampton, MA. She was originally premed, a path she chose because, she says, “I wanted to help people, corny as that sounds.” But after her first chemistry class, she decided not to go into medicine. Her study of neuroscience, and especially her work with HM, started quite accidentally. As a graduate student at McGill University in Montreal, she read a paper by the father of a childhood friend about an experimental procedure to treat severe epilepsy: a bilateral temporal lobectomy.

At the time, treatment for epilepsy often included cutting away parts of the brain implicated in seizures. However, the roles of the various parts of the brain were not really known, so much was learned from the deficits sustained by people who had had parts of their brains surgically removed. In the case of HM, a neurosurgeon, William Scoville, tried something that had never been done before: he completely cut away both sides of HM’s hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped structure deep in the left and right temporal lobes.

Though his seizures abated, the procedure robbed HM of the ability to form new memories. He still had his childhood memories, and his working memory was unchanged, but his brain could no longer consolidate information retained for a few seconds into longer-term memories.

When I ask Corkin about how she met HM, she passes me a signed copy of her book, Permanent Present Tense, which was published last year. “That’s for you,” she says. It’s his biography. “I don’t like to think of it as my memoir, but it is.”

Corkin first met HM in 1962, when she was researching for her PhD thesis on the effect of surgical epilepsy treatment on somatosensory (touch) memory. She tested many epilepsy patients, but was especially excited to work with HM and two other amnesic cases, although at the time she didn’t foresee that working with the young man with no memory would define the rest of her career. “Basically, he fell in my lap...I knew he wasn’t a run-of-the-mill epilepsy patient. But I never had any idea how extremely famous he would become, or that I would study him for the next forty-six years.” 

###'Don't write off women'

Corkin joined MIT in 1964. When she arrived, she was the only woman faculty member in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department. “The first time I started thinking about women’s issues was not when I set foot on MIT’s campus. I was gender-blind. When I came here in 1964, guess how many women were on the faculty, the entire MIT faculty.” She waits for me to guess.

Ten?

“Three.”

 “But still, I never asked, ‘where are the women?’” 

She didn’t start asking until almost thirty years later, when she was approached by a biology professor named Nancy Hopkins. Hopkins had noticed that if a male professor got an offer from another university, he would get a promotion as an incentive to stay, while women weren’t granted such perks. Her run-of-the-mill requests for extra lab space were denied, while male colleagues were given larger labs without even needing to ask. 

The conversation sparked a revelation for Corkin. “I was pretty gender-neutral for many years at MIT, and then I sort of woke up. [It was] Nancy’s starting the discussions. One day Molly Potter [a professor of psychology] walked into my office...and she said, ‘Sue, would you like to have a bigger office?’ And I’m looking around the room; I said, ‘sure!’ But it never occurred to me I was in this cramped little space.”

“[Hopkins] invited me and a couple of other people to have lunch, just in somebody’s office.” Gradually, the lunch meetings grew to include every woman on the faculty of the school of science: seventeen in total. They shared their stories of discrimination and finally compiled a letter to the Dean of Science, Bob Birgeneau. All but one signed it.  

They backed up their case with evidence: they documented differences in space allocations, salaries, and perks. “As good scientists, we collected data. And they spoke for us,” Corkin says. The Dean took the letter seriously, and a committee formed to investigate the discrimination through interviews and further data collection. The result was “A Study on the Status of Women Faculty in Science at MIT”, a groundbreaking report that showed inequity in “space, amount of 9-month salary paid from individual research grants, teaching assignments, awards and distinctions, inclusion on important committees and assignments within the department” (from [the report itself](http://web.mit.edu/fnl/women/women.html)). 

When the committee published its report in 1999, it made the front page of both the New York Times and the Boston Globe. Never before had a prominent university voluntarily outed itself on gender discrimination. The [Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/23/us/mit-admits-discrimination-against-female-professors.html) begins:

>In an extraordinary admission, top officials at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the most prestigious science and engineering university in the country, have issued a report acknowledging that female professors here suffer from pervasive, if unintentional, discrimination.
''I have always believed that contemporary gender discrimination within universities is part reality and part perception,'' the university's president, Charles M. Vest, said in comments to be published in the faculty newsletter within days and already posted on the World Wide Web. ''True, but I now understand that reality is by far the greater part of the balance.''

“Places like Stanford and Harvard, top-tier schools, all came to MIT to see how we did it,” Corkin said. “And now, a month ago, they all came back again, to compare notes on progress.”

The “MIT9”, nine of the nation’s top universities, has met at MIT annually since 2001, focusing first on improving equality for women faculty, and then expanding to address issues faced by underrepresented minorities.

###'Don't take no for an answer'

Even today, as a woman at the top of her field, Corkin says it’s sometimes hard to feel like a part of the “old boys' club.” She says people shy away from being the token woman on a panel, or the token woman speaker at a symposium. She tells them: “any time you get invited to give a talk, you say YES, and you make sure that you give a better talk than any of the men in the symposium.”

I give in to the impulse to submit my own experience. “It can be a lot of pressure, though. It can feel like you have you prove yourself in order to be taken seriously.”

“Absolutely. You do. There is pressure. You have to be tough.”

This lesson is part of what Corkin has taught her students, along with three others she lists for me: "'prepare, prepare, prepare', 'don't take no for an answer', and 'don't write off women and minorities'." 

Her former student, Margaret Keane, who is now a Professor of Psychology at Wellesley College, says Corkin was a patient and supportive, though challenging, mentor. “She provided unlimited resources and whatever of her time you needed,” Keane says.

Even with all she’s done and all she continues to do for the field of memory research, it’s by teaching that Corkin feels she performs her greatest service to the world. Like the undergraduate Corkin, who thought she’d be a doctor, what the Professor Emerita Corkin wants most is to help people.

“The biggest impact that any of us have is in teaching. People don’t always put teaching on the front burner, they put their research on the front burner, and I certainly did that too, but our biggest impact is not in the little crumbs we contribute to science, it’s what we pass along to our students.”
