## Why I am not politically active: one MIT student’s perspective

A classmate recently mentioned that MIT students don’t seem as politically active as students at other schools. She was certainly correct about me. I have nearly zero interest in politics. It does not matter what level the issues occur at – dorm, campus, local, state, or nationwide. For the most part, I don’t feel strongly about those issues. I did not vote in the last presidential election, nor do I affiliate with a political party. My Facebook profile lists my “Political Views” simply as “Go Lakers!” According to my classmate’s statement, my own indifference is perhaps not that unusual at MIT. Regardless of whether that is true, why am I not politically active?

I am aware of most major issues being discussed in the news, and I do have opinions on them. However, few concern me enough to for me to take a stance. A friend and I brainstormed a long list of political issues hoping to find one that I feel strongly about. We found none. Here is a small sampling of reasons why those issues don’t concern me:

Government shutdown – It seems ludicrous that the government can shut itself down, but I am not concerned. None of my friends or family are federal employees, and none of the services that I need have been affected.

Gay marriage – Gay people should be allowed to marry and enjoy the same benefits, but the issue does not concern me enough to vote on it. The gay people I do know have not directly voiced their concerns to me, nor has it affected any of my friends or family.

Obamacare – Decent healthcare should be affordable to everyone, but my family is above the income bracket for qualifying.

I freely admit that my background permits me to ignore these issues that do not affect me. The issues affect countless others, but it is not my job to be an activist and help them. I would take a stance if those people personally urged me to, or if the issue impacted people close to me.

Then there were the issues that do affect me – as well as the reasons why I’m not concerned with them, either, such as:

Social security – Social security is unsustainable and might not provide enough for my parents when they begin drawing from it. I am not interested in this issue because I plan to financially support my parents 100%, regardless of the social security payout.

Any dorm or school policy – The only policies that matter are ones that involve personal safety or graduation. If I am dissatisfied with some other rule or policy at MIT, I am free to enroll elsewhere, so why should I complain? 

Healthcare – Before my mom got a job, my sister and I used state-sponsored low-cost insurance. We could have managed without this option, but it certainly made life easier. I would only take a stance on this issue if we were from a low-income family that required it.

Economy and taxation – My parents have stable jobs, but the economy causes them to lose on the stock market. Taxes cut into all our paychecks (I also work). It may seem nihilistic, but I believe the economy will never be good, and taxes will never be low. I am not interested in this issue as long as the situation is not egregiously bad.

Gun control – I would care more about this issue if I lived in a violent area. I believe that no law can prevent a person from killing someone if he really wants to. There is no easy solution to this issue.

Affirmative action in college admissions ¬¬– I am Asian American, and I believe that affirmative action hurts my group in college admissions. I believe that race should not be considered as a factor in admissions, but any challenges caused by race should be considered. Affirmative action is the wrong way to consider those challenges. Although I disagree with the policy, it did not concern me when applying for college because I just had to work harder at that time.

I believe that the policymakers – at school, local, and national levels ¬¬– is incapable of solving any of my problems. It would be great if policymakers could make my life easier, but I do not trust them to do that. Our government’s incompetence causes me to feel apathetic about most issues that affect me.

As long as my safety, well-being, and ability to pursue a better life are guaranteed, I am ok with the status quo. If any issues ever threaten that minimum standard of living for me or the people I care about, I would immediately become just as politically active as anyone else. Until then, I simply have no reason to take a stance on most issues.
