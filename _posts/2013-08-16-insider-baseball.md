<br>This essay by <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1988/oct/27/insider-baseball/?pagination=false" target="_blank">**Joan Didion** first appeared in _The New York Review of Books_ on October 27, 1988</a>, less than two weeks before that year's presidential election, and was later featured in her 2001 collection, _Political Fictions_. Like all of Didion's best work, this one simultaneously explains and deconstructs the narratives people (in this case politicians) craft to help them get through their days.
