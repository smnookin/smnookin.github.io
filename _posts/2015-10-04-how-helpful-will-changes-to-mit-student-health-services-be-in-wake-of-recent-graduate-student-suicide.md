MIT graduate student Cara Anne Nickolaus was a free-spirited mentor for many and an excellent pupil. This made her suicide on September 20th that much more difficult to grasp. Her death followed a year of many college student suicides and attempted suicides across the nation. 

MIT is considered one of the leaders in establishing campus-wide efforts to tackle student mental health.  As a result, the administration and student body viewed the deaths of the past year, including that of Nickolaus, as a huge call-to-action to enhance mental health and wellness on college campuses. With promises of more counseling and support options and fairer readmission policies, MIT administrators are assuring a stronger, healthier MIT community.  

However, in the wake of the recent campus suicide, this new push for campus health services leads many to questioning if these changes will actually be beneficial for the student body. 

The changes include an increase in staff that helps students in need. This includes two new full-time psychologists at mental health & counseling, and one new staff member at Student Support Services. However, if you go to mental health & counseling today, you will struggle to make an appointment for the near future.

Jacob Martin is an MIT sophomore who has had his fair share of experience with the mental health system on and off campus. He claimed that both last year and this year, it had taken a while for him to get into the mental health and counseling office to see a clinician for the first appointment, but once he meets for that first time he can usually get an appointment every week. “I just got an appointment [at the end of September], and it’s scheduled for the middle of October. That is a long ways a way.”

Last year Martin had seen a resident mental health clinician at MIT Medical to tackle his developed depression as a freshman at MIT. However, his counselor had finished his residency and left mental health & counseling, leaving Martin without a support system at MIT Medical, and forcing him to go through the process of getting to know a new counselor and waiting for an appointment all over again.

This is very difficult for students during a time of struggle. Not only had the resident that Martin was seeing left his position, but also MIT has lost several social workers. This includes one that left for maternity leave, Dr. Corona, and another who retired from the department, James Chansky. These are clinicians who had relationships with the students and connected with them. 

Dr. Alan Siegel, Chief of Mental Health & Counseling Services at MIT, said that there have been some shifts in the faces of the staff at mental health and counseling, but that overall the services are increasing the numbers of available clinicians. Eventually.

Siegel says that the search process to find replacements  “is in high gear.” The office is currently at one less clinician than at the end of last semester.

Additionally, there will be a new, centrally located mental health & counseling location for extra drop-in hours, called “Let’s Chat”. Still, Siegel says that the new drop-in hours “won't take away clinical time because the four clinicians who staff it will do what we would do if they covered our morning clinic or walk in.” Students are skeptical on how this will improve their abilities to get appointments sooner, especially in the short-term when the semester is really picking up and getting stressful.

Mental health & counseling also finally dropped their phone appointment system that required students to call and explain that they are having problems to a receptionist and then to a mental health clinician before they could see a counselor. The system has been and replaced with an online appointment request form. “It lowers the barrier of entry to getting help,” Martin said.

However, there is still a stigma regarding getting help for students who are struggling at MIT. “Depression is a bitch. It makes you not want to get help.” Said Martin. Furthermore, students hear horror stories from friends about bad experiences getting help or miscommunications with their counselors that had led to hospitalization or forced leave from MIT. 

It was stated in the Chancellor’s email “students have expressed concerns about the clarity, transparency, and fairness of existing policies, and about the level of support for students who take time away and transition back to MIT.” This is in response to many students claiming lack of support for students who left MIT voluntarily or involuntarily.

Martin said, “People have had really nightmarish experiences with trying to come back and with the re-entry process which can be really arbitrary.” 

There is no doubt that MIT is attempting to address the mental health problems on campus from many different angles. Yet, some students are still cynical about how it will work out and what this year will bring. “They are trying to make some changes - I’m not sure that they are better and how much is actual sincere desire to actually make a full effort.”
