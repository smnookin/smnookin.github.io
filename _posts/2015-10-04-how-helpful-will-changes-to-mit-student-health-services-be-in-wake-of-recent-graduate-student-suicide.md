On September 20th, just one week into the new semester, MIT graduate student Cara Anne Nickolaus committed suicide. This followed a year of many college student suicides and attempted suicides across the nation. 

The events of this past year led to college administration being called to action to enhance mental health and wellness on college campuses. MIT is one of the colleges that are considered to be in the lead of good campus-wide efforts to tackle the suicide epidemic.  With promises of more counseling and support options and fairer readmission policies, MIT administrators are promising a stronger, healthier MIT community.  

However, in the wake of the recent campus suicide, now is a time to ask important questions regarding these new changes to the campus health system, and if they will actually be beneficial for the student body.

On September 2nd, MIT Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart and MIT Medical Director and Head William Kettyle sent an email to the MIT community outlining specific changes that would be made to the support systems on campus. They sent this email after many conversations, emails, focus groups and formal proposes from students, as well as a [2015 Health Minds Study](http://chancellor.mit.edu/2015-healthy-minds-study-results) that many MIT students filled out.

The changes include an increase in staff that helps students in need. This includes two new full-time psychologists at mental health & counseling, and one new member to Student Support Services staff. However, if you go to mental health & counseling today, you will struggle to make an appointment for the near future.

Jacob Martin is an MIT sophomore who has had his fair share of experience with the mental health system on and off campus. He claimed that both last year and this year, it had taken a while for him to get into the mental health and counseling office to see a clinician for the first appointment, but once he meets for that first time he can usually get an appointment every week. “I just got an appointment [at the end of September], and it’s scheduled for the middle of October. That is a long ways a way.”

Dr. Alan Siegel, Chief of Mental Health & Counseling Services at MIT, said that there have been some shifts in the faces of the staff at mental health and counseling, but that overall the services are increasing the numbers of available clinicians. Eventually.

“Dr. Corona, who joined us last Fall, decided not to return from maternity leave.” Additionally, a full-time social worker, James Chansky, wrote an email to his students this past July about his leave from MIT, stating “I will be retiring from my position as a Social Worker in the Mental Health and Counseling Department at the end of August 2015.”

On James Chansky’s leave, Siegel says, “We will hire a full time social worker to replace Jim, and the search process is in high gear. There are two new psychology positions, and we have hired two new full time clinicians.” Said Dr. Siegel. These new psychologists will begin within the next month. This leaves the office currently at one less clinician than at the end of last semester.

Additionally, there will be a new, centrally located mental health & counseling location for extra drop-in hours, called “Let’s Chat”. But even with the new positions, Siegel says that the new drop-in hours “won't take away clinical time because the 4 clinicians who staff it will do what we would do if they covered our morning clinic or walk in.” Students are skeptical on how this will improve their abilities to get appointments sooner, especially in the short-term when the semester is really picking up and getting stressful.

Mental health & counseling also finally dropped their phone appointment system that required students to call and explain that they are having problems to a receptionist and then to a mental health clinician before they could see a counselor. The system has been and replaced with an online appointment request form. “It lowers the barrier of entry to getting help,” Martin said.

However, there is still a stigma regarding getting help for students who are struggling at MIT. “Depression is a bitch. It makes you not want to get help.” Said Martin. Furthermore, students hear horror stories from friends about bad experiences getting help or miscommunications with their counselors that had led to hospitalization or forced leave from MIT.

It was stated in the Chancellor’s email “students have expressed concerns about the clarity, transparency, and fairness of existing policies, and about the level of support for students who take time away and transition back to MIT.” This is in response to many students claiming lack of support for students who left MIT voluntarily or involuntarily.

Martin said, “People have had really nightmarish experiences with trying to come back and with the re-entry process which can be really arbitrary.” 

There is no doubt that MIT is attempting to address the mental health problems on campus from many different angles. Yet, students are still cynical about how it will work out and what this year will bring. “They are trying to make some changes - I’m not sure that they are better and how much is actual sincere desire to actually make a full effort.”
