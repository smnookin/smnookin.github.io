## A New Post
![](/http://media.nbcwashington.com/images/1200*675/student-college-depressed.jpg)
At MIT, we like to do things the hard way. We work hard. We play hard. Everything is hard.This also applies to how we deal with mental health. We do it the hard way because, as a student body, we don’t do it at all.

MIT has one of the most extensive Mental Health care facilities on a university campus, yet, no one seems willing to take advantage of it. If they do, most people certainly do not talk about it. After the most recent suicide, I have read angry letters about what MIT as an administration could have done better, but to be honest, I don’t think the main problem lies there. It lies in the mentality of the student body.

When I was waiting my turn for my first appointment to see a counselor at Mental Health last fall, I was the only person sitting in the grey upholstered seats. I was surrounded by a flock of empty gray chairs, a flurry of untouched magazines itching to be flipped open by nervous fingers, but no other students. 

My lack of compatriots remained constant throughout the rest of the school year. As my appointments became more frequent, the emptiness of the waiting room remained constant.

Why is no one else climbing the stairs of MIT Medical to the third floor, passing through the long white, narrow hallway to take advantage of the free mental health services?

My theory is that people in general, but especially MIT students, just can’t admit that kind of vulnerability. We at MIT are more than comfortable slogging down the infinite declaring “I’m so ‘hosed’, I slept 2 hours the past three days.” You won’t hear a peep, not even a whisper, of, “and I can’t do it on my own anymore. I need help.” 

Not in the infinite. 
Not in the libraries. 
Not in the dorms.

It has become a form of social currency to declare how hard our lives are, how overworked we are. The part where it gets tricky is, we also put an expectation on each other to get it done and solve our personal problems, but not our PSets, on our own. We are MIT students. We are strong, self sufficient, intelligent, but we hate to admit that we are also fallible. MIT is already a blow to the ego (at least it was for me), so perhaps students feel they can’t take the extra hit by seeking out therapy. I think if we swallowed our pride and were open to utilizing the services provided to us, and going even a step further and being open with our friends and classmates about it, the stigma around mental health at MIT would lessen.

The reason I even made the initial visit to Mental Health was because one of my close friends disclosed to me that she was a frequent patient. 

I didn’t even make an appointment. I went straight after class, made the long contemplative walk to Medical, and doubted every step of the way if I was making the right decision. 

When I finally made it to the desk, I locked eyes with one of the secretaries and said “I need to see somebody, and I need to see them now.” 

After a blur of paperwork, I was taken into one of the pleasant but dull counseling rooms, where I was greeted by a warm smile and a hug. My mouth and my tear ducts opened simultaneously, opening the flood gates of a year of tension. I talked of my injury from volleyball, I talked of how unhappy I was in my major and in my relationship, I talked of my problems back home, and I talked of how I didn’t want to be at MIT anymore but didn’t know what to do, all while depleting them of a months supply of tissues. The first visit ended with me taking two chocolates from the green glass bowl on the desk along with another appointment for next week. 

At first, yes, it was a little awkward. The second visit I didn’t have the fervor to pour my soul out as I had in the first. As I got to know my counselor better, it got easier. We even began cracking jokes together.
I never felt judged, I never felt that she thought I was crazy, and I never felt that I couldn’t tell her exactly what I was thinking. I never even got a “diagnosis”. Whether or not I needed one I guess I will never know.

I also never got any concrete answers, which was a little frustrating at first. For example, if I asked her if I should break up with my boyfriend, I was never met with a straightforward answer, just more probing questions. I have since realized that if you have to ask that question at all the answer is probably a resounding yes. It is certainly an imbalanced relationship, as my therapist knew absolutely everything about me, though I know next to nothing about her, apart from what I could glean from little items around her office: the ring on her wedding finger, the photograph of a dog on her desk.

No, my counselor did not help me get my grades up, or help me end my broken relationship, or help me repair my injured shoulder or mollify tense relationships at home, but she did help me find the peace of mind for me to do it myself. 9 months and 34 appointments after my first visit, I no longer felt the need to go. I would not hesitate to go back should the need arise.

I have been extremely open about going to Mental Health with my friends and classmates. I would miss a team meeting for my lab class, and I wouldn’t hide where I was going. I’d tell them I was going to my appointment at Mental Health. Recently, a friend from that class actually emailed me for advice because she was thinking of going to Mental Health, but wasn’t sure how to approach it. I told her to do what I did: Just go. Just go and tell them you want to talk. They will listen.

I think if we can be more open with each other about seeking treatment, those who also need the help won’t be afraid to step forward and take it. I don’t know if Phoebe Wang ever sought treatment at Mental Health, and I don’t know if the three other suicides that have occurred since school started in September did either, but I will speculate that if they had, President Reif would not have had so write as many emails that opened with “It breaks my heart to tell you.”

I do think the main problem is the student body’s attitude towards mental health, but there are certainly more things the administration can do as well. Though we are widely considered the best University in the world, and probably the hardest as well, other schools of comparable quality have lower suicide rates. The national average at Universities is 7.2 suicides per every 10,000 students. At MIT, the number is 10.2. At Harvard, it is 6.18.

I am not necessarily saying that we need to be more like Harvard academically. I am glad that we don’t suffer from massive grade inflation and coddling. I think we can keep the MIT rigor in tact while also giving ourselves a little break from the insanity occasionally. At my high school, for example, we would have a “no homework weekend”. It is pretty self explanatory, but essentially we would get a weekend where no homework could be assigned the Friday before, and no assignments could be due the next two days after. I don’t think professors would necessarily be keen on this idea, but it would certainly give us a weekend to actually get back into the world! Perhaps students would even, (GASP) get off campus and into Boston! Or New York City! OR LITERALLY ANYWHERE THAT IS NOT CAMBRIDGE. It would give us a chance to actually have a weekend to sleep in and enjoy the company of our friends without a massive PSet looming over our heads.

I also think we could implement test waves, where it is forbidden to have multiple tests in one week. Every professor seems to be on the same schedule: an exam every four weeks. This is a problem because suddenly 4 TESTS IN ONE WEEK WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN OH MY GOD. This seems absurd to me because most of us are on pretty conventional schedules within our major, so everyone in a given year and major is taking the same 4 or 5 classes together. If these professors could, I don’t know, communicate (what does that even mean) with each other so that they don’t schedule their tests one after the other in a non-optional buffet line of exams, it might reduce the number of “hell weeks”.

There is a lot that we can do to improve how we approach mental health at MIT. It will probably take a lot of time and a lot of effort both on an individual and interpersonal as well as institutional level. But it will be worth it, even if it only saves four lives out of 10,000.
