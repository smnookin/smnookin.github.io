Empty chairs waiting to be filled by students seeking proactive mental health care.

At MIT, we like to do things the hard way. We work hard. We play hard. Everything is hard. This also applies to how we deal with mental health. We do it the hard way because, as a student body, we often don't deal with our mental health at all.

MIT has has vastly improved their mental health services over the years. The Institute started the [Mental Health Task](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2001/clay-0829) force to create drastic changes in 2001 after being sued by the family of [young female victim of suicide](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/28/magazine/who-was-responsible-for-elizabeth-shin.html). No one seems willing to take advantage of the new and improved system. If they do, most people certainly do not talk about it. The effects of this attitude show in the statistics. [The national average of suicides amongst college students is 7.2 deaths per every 10,000 students. At MIT, the number is 10.6 for the entire institution and 20.2 for just undergraduates](http://web.mit.edu/~sdavies/www/mit-suicides/). After the most recent suicide, I have read angry letters about what MIT as an administration could have done better. To be honest, I don’t think the main problem lies there. It lies in the mentality of the student body.

When I was waiting for my first appointment to see a counselor at Mental Health last fall, I was the only person sitting in the grey upholstered seats. I was surrounded by a flock of empty gray chairs, a flurry of untouched magazines itching to be flipped open by nervous fingers, but no other students. 

My lack of compatriots remained constant throughout the rest of the school year. As my appointments became more frequent, the emptiness of the waiting room remained constant.

Why is no one else climbing the stairs of MIT Medical to the third floor, passing through the long white, narrow hallway to take advantage of the free mental health services?

My theory is that people in general, but especially MIT students, just can’t admit that kind of vulnerability. 

We at MIT are more than comfortable slogging down the infinite declaring “I’m so ‘hosed’, I slept 2 hours the past three days.” You won’t hear a peep, not even a whisper, of, “and I can’t do it on my own anymore. I need help.” 

Not in the Infinite. 
Not in the libraries. 
Not in the dorms.

It has become a form of social currency to declare how hard our lives are, how overworked we are. It gets tricky when we also put an expectation on each other to get it done, solving our personal problems, but not our PSets, on our own. This makes our feelings of inadequacy even more intense, because we think that we aren't as capable of handling the pressure (or our failures) as our peers are, adding another self perceived weakness to the growing list.

We are MIT students. We are strong, self sufficient, intelligent, but we hate to admit out loud that we are also fallible. MIT is already a blow to the ego (at least it was for me), so perhaps students feel they can’t suffer the double stigma of struggling in school and wanting therapy. I don't think I was ever the smartest kid in my class in highschool, but I was up there. At MIT, I can't help but feel to be near the bottom half of the academic food chain. I know I am not the only one. 

Many kids who probably were the best and brightest in their highschool communities have suddenly been thrown back down to earth, facing a below average GPA. By definition, 50% of undergrads have to be at or below the average, which can seem like a long way to fall if you were, say, a Valedictorian or Salutatorian. Perhaps it is too much to admit that we aren't the smartest people in the room anymore, and that we feel demoralized. On top of that, we have to admit that we are losing our grips on our mental stability? How many hits against our brains can we take? I sometimes felt like I was beginning to lose control of my mind academically and emotionally. What's worse, is we often can't recognize that others are experiencing the same feelings we are because we don't talk about it. I think if we swallowed our pride and were open to utilizing the services provided to us, going even a step further and being open with our friends and classmates about it, the stigma around mental health at MIT would lessen.

The reason I even made the initial visit to Mental Health was because one of my close friends disclosed to me that she was a frequent patient. 

I didn’t even make an appointment. I went straight after class, made the long contemplative walk to Medical, and doubted every step of the way if I was making the right decision. I had heard rumors...of spectral beings going to Mental Health and being forced to leave MIT against their will. I had heard of nameless, faceless people having bad experiences there. I had heard it was a waste of time.

When I finally made it to the desk, I locked eyes with one of the secretaries and said “I need to see somebody, and I need to see them now.” 

After a blur of paperwork, I was taken into one of the pleasant but dull counseling rooms, where I was greeted by a warm smile and a hug. My mouth and my tear ducts opened simultaneously, pouring out a year's worth of pent up tension. I talked of my injury from volleyball, I talked of how unhappy I was in my major and in my relationship, I talked of my problems back home, and I talked of how I didn’t want to be at MIT anymore but didn’t know what to do, all while depleting them of a months supply of tissues. The first visit ended with me taking two chocolates from the green glass bowl on the desk along with another appointment for next week. 

At first, yes, it was a little awkward. The second visit I didn’t have the fervor to pour my soul out as I had in the first. As I got to know my counselor better, it got easier. We even began cracking jokes together.
I never felt judged, I never felt that she thought I was crazy, and I never felt that I couldn’t tell her exactly what I was thinking. I never even got a “diagnosis”. Whether or not I needed one I guess I will never know.

I also never got any concrete answers, which was a little frustrating at first. For example, if I asked her if I should break up with my boyfriend, I was never met with a straightforward answer, just more probing questions. I have since realized that if you have to ask that question at all the answer is probably a resounding yes. Sometimes I wished she would just tell me what to do with my life and solve all my problems for me: It took me a few visits to realize that I was seeing a counselor, not a fairy godmother. Though she was certainly kind and warm, and we were certainly friendly, I don't think I could call her my friend either. It is certainly an imbalanced, unique relationship. She knew absolutely everything about me, though I know next to nothing about her, apart from what I could glean from little items around her office: the ring on her wedding finger, the photograph of a dog on her desk.

No, my counselor did not help me get my grades up, or help me end my broken relationship, or help me repair my injured shoulder, but she did help me find the peace of mind for me to do it myself. 9 months and 34 appointments after my first visit, I no longer felt the need to go. I would not hesitate to go back should the need (or desire) arise.

I have been extremely open about going to Mental Health with my friends and classmates. I would miss a team meeting for my lab class, and I’d tell them I was going to my appointment at Mental Health. Recently, a friend from that class actually emailed me for advice because she was thinking of going for an appointment, but wasn’t sure how to approach it. I told her to do what I did: Just go. Just go and tell them you want to talk. They will listen. It worked like a Rube Goldberg machine: Just as my friend pushed me to go to Mental Health, I pushed someone else in a chain reaction of care. 

I think if we can be more open with each other about seeking treatment, those who also need the help won’t be afraid to step forward and take it. I don’t know if [Phoebe Wang ever sought treatment at Mental Health, and I don’t know if the three other suicides](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/25/mitdeath/ScTVxNN3IVJDLpPzMDRLWM/story.html) that have occurred since school started in September did either, but I will speculate that if they had, President Reif would not have had so write as many emails that opened with “It breaks my heart to tell you.”

There is a lot that we can do to improve how we approach mental health at MIT. It will probably take a lot of time and a lot of effort both on an individual and interpersonal as well as institutional level. But it will be worth it, even if it only saves one life out of 10,000.
