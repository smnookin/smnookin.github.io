![Aaron Swartz](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg)
Two months after Aaron Swartz's suicide, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/03/11/130311fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=all" target="_blank">_The New Yorker_ explored the young programmer's "darker side."</a> MacFarquhar uses long excerpts from interviews with Swartz's family and friends, as well as Swartz's own writing, to build a portrait of a brilliant but complex man. "If you can do anything you want, then every day becomes an existential problem," she writes, "--an empty space of possibility that has no ceiling but also no walls and no floor."
