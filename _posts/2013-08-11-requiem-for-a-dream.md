Two months after Aaron Swartz's suicide, New Yorker staff writer Larissa MacFarquhar explores the young programmer's "darker side." She uses long excerpts from interviews with Swartz's family and friends, as well as his own writing, to build a portrait of a brilliant but complex man. "If you can do anything you want, then every day becomes an existential problem," she writes, "--an empty space of possibility that has no ceiling but also no walls and no floor."
