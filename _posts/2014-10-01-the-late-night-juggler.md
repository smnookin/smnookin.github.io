Three in the morning and the main hallway that cuts through MIT's campus is, for once, pretty much silent. From Lobby 10, as the grand chamber that originally served as MIT's front entrance is known, you can hear the faint hum of industrial floor buffers at work. There's also a distinct patter coming from in front of the elevators.  

Standing there is a man with a ponytail and goatee. He wears black pants and a blue button-down shirt, and keeps an e-cigarrette on hand. His head is bowed in concentration at the floor in front of him, where his hands are sending seven red balls against the floor in a quick-paced rhythm.

Meet Nicholas Ferri -- or, as he prefers to be known, Smyly the Juggler. Nearly every sentence out of Ferri's mouth ends with a tidbit about juggling -- how it's good for your brain or how it improves your well-being. He should know: He's been practicing late into the night in the halls of MIT every week for the last twenty-four years. 

At twelve years old, Ferri worked as a shoe-shine boy in downtown Boston. Shoe shining wasn't a particularly popular or engaging profession, and soon Ferri began picking up tricks from other vendors, including juggling. From there he discovered the MIT Juggling Club -- and he's been practicing his craft in Lobby 10 ever since.

Over the years, Ferri's nocturnal presence has made him a friend to MIT's janitorial staff and the campus police alike. He has come to serve as the _de facto_ guardian of Lobby 10, which itself acts as a memorial to those in the MIT community lost during World War I. If people try to disrespect the environment, Ferri handles them: "Bouncing something off the wall? You don’t do that," he says. "It’s a memorial. Writing something on the wall? You don’t do that." About a year ago, when there was a threat of a potential gunman on campus, the police made sure to let Ferri know. He informed them that he stood ready to throw a juggler's club if necessary.

What's particularly amazing about Ferri's status in the Infinite is how he holds no connection to MIT itself. He has never been a student; he's never been a TA for a class; he's not in the MIT directory. His only real connection is the MIT Juggling Club -- which at the moment does not possess any current student members. But thanks to MIT's open campus policy, which allows the public to roam the Institute’s hallways without escort or a limit to visiting hours, he's become an integral part of the Institute's fabric. "Not a lot of people who don’t go to school here come here, unless they’re doing something malicious," he says. "But you know everyone looks out for each other here at MIT, which is why you can have that open campus thing."

Almost a quarter of a century after first juggling in the Infinite, Ferri stays through the early morning and protects his corner of a college which has come to adopt him. "I was here juggling last night until probably 4:30, didn't get to bed until six in the morning," said Ferri, "I go home, I watch _The Cleveland Show_, I go to bed, you know?" He chuckled. "_Cleveland Show_ -- that's my show." Before saying good night, however, he made a point to invite me to an upcoming juggling event. I'm sure it will be educational.
