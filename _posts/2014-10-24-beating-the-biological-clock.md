![clip_image006.jpg](https://flic.kr/p/xPrTx) It’s not science fiction; it’s the ultimate family planning tool. [Facebook and Apple announced](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/apple-facebook-pay-female-employees-freeze-eggs/) that they’ll be providing female employees with egg freezing services-- a procedure that costs over $10,000 out of pocket. Though some worry about new expectations on working women, this is a step toward removing some of the impediments that keep more women from rising in the tech industry.

[Some argue](http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/20/opinion/almeling-radin-richardson-egg-freezing/) that making egg freezing available will make it an expectation in the tech industry that families come later -- if you don’t wait, you won’t succeed. The worry is that this would bar women who don’t want to delay family life from making it in the workplace. But there’s already a bar in place: due to the still-inequitable distribution of household labor, starting a family can prevent a woman from rising in a high-intensity industry. Having children later in life increases the risks of birth defects and complications with pregnancy, so women may find themselves choosing between establishing the careers they want and having a family. If the choice was instead between a career and kids immediately, more women might choose to wait. Freezing is an opportunity -- a chance to delay rather than forgo parenthood. Some people will always want to have kids early, and employers shouldn’t penalize them, but they should also take this measure to remove the anxiety from waiting.

Parents of young children talk about guilt: every hour spent forwarding their professional development is an hour not spent with their kids. [Some argue](http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/10/you-cover-egg-freezing-also-cover-day-care.html) that delaying having kids wouldn’t solve this issue, and that companies should focus on making it easier for employees, especially women, to balance jobs and families -- by providing childcare, for example. Those services should be available for working parents, but no matter what measures are taken, work/life balance is never going to be easy. Kids and work are always going to be opposite pulls on a parent’s time. Egg freezing provides a way to make sure the most time-intensive phases of each don’t coincide.

Providing egg freezing is a step in the right direction, but Facebook and Apple should go further: Egg freezing should be offered to the partners of employees, too. [Working women say](http://qz.com/285239/these-are-the-conversations-your-female-employees-are-having-about-egg-freezing/) that the lack of paternal leave at many companies is a major burden on mothers: it enforces the norm that women stay home with the kids while men continue to work. If male employees and their partners could also choose to wait, those spouses would not have the burden of raising kids essentially solo while their husbands (or partners) continue to work long hours. Big tech companies like Apple and Google already provide generous (by market standards) [maternity and paternity leave](http://www.businessinsider.com/maternity-paternity-leave-policies-at-google-facebook-yahoo-twitter-microsoft-2013-8), for biological and adoptive parents. It's common sense that a perk like egg freezing should apply to the partners of employees as well as employees themselves.

Giving people more control over the trajectory of their lives is a good thing. Of course, providing egg freezing is also a business strategy: Facebook and Apple no doubt hope that more employees will hold off on starting families and put more time into their jobs. But this is still an empowering step for women who want to wait, but who are afraid of the risks involved. It’s a technological victory over the biological clock.
