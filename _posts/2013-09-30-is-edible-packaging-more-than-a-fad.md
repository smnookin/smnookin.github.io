![](http://celebrationcakesmex.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/6647.jpg)Think about the amount of plastic you accumulate on a typical grocery run. The cereal is in a sealed plastic bag inside its box, as are granola bars, cookies, and the single-serving hot cocoa packets. The fruits and vegetables all get their own bags. Candies and chewing gum are individually wrapped within the larger pack.

What if you could have your candy and eat the wrappers too? One current innovation targeted at minimizing the use of plastics in food products is edible packaging. Given that plastic packaging constitutes almost one third of annual solid waste in the U.S., many companies are vying to be at the forefront of this new technology. [MonoSol](http://www.fastcompany.com/1812661/monosol-creates-innovative-dissolvable-packaging-combat-waste), known for its dissolvable laundry-detergent packets, is branching into food products, currently developing hot chocolate, spice strips, and oatmeal that come in dissolvable packets, and Bob’s, a Brazilian burger chain, has introduced edible wrappers for its burgers. Although these initiatives are dedicated to developing more environmentally friendly packaging, their products nevertheless encourage a lifestyle that relies on the single-serving rather than questioning underlying habits of food consumption.

One company stands out among the rest: [WikiFoods](http://www.wikipearl.com/#wikipearl), co-founded by Harvard professor David Edwards and French designer François Azambourg, is mimicking the natural properties of fruits with protective skins like grapes and apples in the hopes of developing edible, protective membranes for everything from snacks to full meals. Unlike the other companies mentioned above, WikiFoods wants to influence not only how we buy food, but how we eat food, an equally important part of the packaging problem. The company uses a technology called WikiCell that creates a kind of hydrocolloid network, composed of a gelatinous skin with traces of chitosan and alginate, as well as a hard exterior shell, made from plant fibers found in sugarcane, to preserve the product’s overall form. The opportunity to embed vitamins and other nutrients into the skin also presents a potential health benefit.
 
According to Heloise Vilaseca, who oversees WikiFoods’ product development, the exact formulation of the skin for any given product can take up to 50 trials, spanning weeks to months, depending on the food and its particular characteristics. Their first line of products, sold only at the company’s own café/shop near the Louvre in Paris, are called Wikipearls and include ice-cream, cheese, yogurt, juice and coffee, all sealed with Wiki skin into bite-sized balls. They come in a variety of colors, embellished with seeds, herbs and nuts for flavor as well as texture. The color is largely dictated by the choice of food extracts, but the size is more flexible, designed around consumer expectations. For now, they can only make spheres because of geometrical constraints of the company’s current technology, but Vilaseca said that won’t be the case for long, and that testing of different shapes is already under way.     

Despite the edible skin, the café/shop still relies on conventional, biodegradable packaging for customers who want their WikiPearls to go. This contradiction is a reminder that packaging serves many purposes. It not only keeps food clean and unspoiled, but also makes it easy to transport. 

Public perception is also a problem. Even though WikiFoods complies with food hygiene standards, their products are so different from traditional foods that consumers might be skeptical of their safety. (Note that WikiFoods’ initial prototypes focus on dairy products and drinks, a food type consumers would be more open to eating in different shapes and colors than, say, fish or meat.)

Going through a pile of apples with other grocery-shoppers at the supermarket, each trying to pick out the juiciest or sweetest ones is relatively normal and within the bounds of supermarket etiquette; we may be less-inclined to sift through chocolates or nuts with our bare hands. Vilaseca said she’s optimistic about edible packaging, describing the company’s vision of a future where all foods can be bought and prepared like fruit, ready to eat with a quick rinse under the faucet, but acknowledges that this process will inevitably involve educating the consumer on new ways of eating and that it’ll take a long time to replace traditional packaged foods.
