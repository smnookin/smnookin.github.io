![](http://matt.might.net/articles/my-sons-killer/images/taken.jpg)I found my son's killer. It took three years. But we did it.<br>
I should clarify one point: my son is very much alive.<br>
Yet, my wife Cristina and I have been found responsible for his death.<br>
My son Bertrand has a new genetic disorder. Patient 0.<br>
To find it, a team of scientists at Duke University used whole-exome sequencing (a protein-focused variant of whole-genome sequencing) on me, my wife and my son.
