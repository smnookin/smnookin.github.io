Before I even stepped foot on my college campus, I had already picked out one of my classes: Making Public Policy. I loved everything about that class—the readings, the professor, and most importantly, the discussions about the ways humans defy rational models.

It wasn’t until later that I realized not everyone felt the same way. After all, I go to MIT, a technical institution. Unlike Harvard down the street or Boston University across the river, almost no one comes here to major in anything other than STEM. Still MIT, in an attempt to diversify its students’ backgrounds requires on average one class per semester in the humanities, arts and social sciences (HASS).

I love this requirement, but I wondered how faculty felt about humanities at MIT. So a few weeks ago, I trekked over to the office of Arthur Bahr, an MIT professor in medieval literature. He told me about [an op-ed that the Dean of MIT’s School of HASS had written](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/04/30/mit-humanities-are-just-important-stem/ZOArg1PgEFy2wm4ptue56I/story.html) earlier this year supporting the importance of humanities at MIT. Arthur said the article made him feel like MIT was stepping up to the plate and defending the humanities. It was trying to point out, he said, that beauty matters.

In the article, Dean Fitzgerald certainly lays out a compelling argument about why MIT, a “bastion for STEM education” cares about the humanities. But to do so, she describes the utility of the humanities to those who typically graduate from MIT—scientists, engineers, doctors, or entrepreneurs. And I couldn’t help but feel a little sad. Because there was not a single statement about beauty in that entire article.

See, there are often two types of justification made for the value of humanities. The first is that studying the humanities helps everyone, including technical employees, do their jobs better. Because problems in the world are often interdisciplinary, studying humanities teaches individuals how to overcome the social barriers in their fields. This justification filled most of the Dean’s article, with examples of MIT alums like a doctor who learned how to interpret her patients’ stories from her study of narratives in literature, and an engineering entrepreneur who found her economics and history classes useful to understand how ideas flow. 

Not surprisingly, this is unfortunately the main justification we hear at MIT. Working with people and effectively communicating are essential skills, and taking humanities classes will help students learn how to apply communication skills well in their technical fields. A creative writing professor here once told me that when she told others that she taught writing at MIT, their responses were always, “Oh, of course. Engineers need to know how to write.” Writing becomes a service discipline for engineers, even though creative writing or art are completely different from a scientific paper in _Nature_. 

The second level of justification is that studying the humanities enables you to develop a mode of engagement with the world that transforms your approach into an integrated perspective. Even Arthur, in justifying the “utility of the humanities,” described a common mode of inquiry and re-inquiry, testing an argument, refining it based on counterarguments, or motivating others to believe the argument that is applicable whether the object is a poem, chemical data set, or sociological study. This justification is much less common in the first—it’s something you might see on a [department website](http://shc.stanford.edu/why-do-humanities-matter) or in a discussion with a professor but rarely as a common way technical students might think about the humanities. 

While the second justification is better at valuing the humanities in the human experience, a third explanation is needed—creating and understanding beauty for its own sake matters. It’s _interesting_ to think about how the structure of a particular novel affects the way readers perceive the content, or how music interacts with storytelling, or about how society functioned a thousand years ago, simply because these topics exemplify knowledge and creativity. 

We are far from being able to appreciate art, history, writing, and literature in this way, and this is not limited to the MIT experience. In a world with limited resources, we have fallen into the trap of resorting to usefulness as a way to distinguish disciplines. Nor is this exclusively done to humanities—[Cambridge University literature professor Stefan Collini claims](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/05/oh-the-humanities/) that this shift in valuing the humanities is representative of the larger shift in universities, where “creating knowledge for the sake of knowledge” has lost inherent value. How can it have value when research funding hinges on proving the work’s usefulness in the world? The justification for studying a field is rarely, _this is so cool_. 

Having taken classes in over 80% of the departments at MIT, I can speak endlessly on the utility of that breadth of classes. But I don’t really have to; the fact that they are experiences in critical thinking and imagination is intrinsically valuable. Still, someone who studies theoretical physics or math, which is more similar to art than engineering, with this justification will not be questioned like someone who decides to study humanities for the same reason. Where is the useful application? What pressing problems are you solving? And where is the money?

[In his novel, _Chinaman_,](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/chinaman-by-shehan-karunatilaka-2276043.html) Shehan Karunatilaka portrays an individual obsessed with cricket, who forces us to come to grips with this very question in sports: "I have been told by members of my own family that there is no use or value in sports... Left-arm [spin-bowling] cannot teach your children or cure your disease. But once in a while, the very best of them will bowl a ball that will bring an entire nation to its feet. And while there may be no practical use in that, there is most certainly value.”

Humanities and other subjects do not need to claim any usefulness to have value. They are explorations of the greater truths that make us human, and that should be good enough.
