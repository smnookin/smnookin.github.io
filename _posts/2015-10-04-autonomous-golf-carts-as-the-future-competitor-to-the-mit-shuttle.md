### The MIT Shuttle monopoly is about to be broken.

Coming up in the next few years, MIT students will have the option to drive in self-driving carts to class, lab, lunch, you name it.

This free MIT shuttle-like service with self-driving carts will be implemented in order for the creators test out the cart sensors and collect pedestrian data for research.

This idea was surfaced from the laboratory of Professor Jonathan How, a researcher in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics as well as Editor-in-Chief and Technical Associate Editor of the IEEE Control Systems Magazine. 

The carts are part of a controls systems project to collect big data from pedestrians and compile it for research. There’s no catch, no surveys to fill, no fees to pay. A student can just call up the cart and ride. And it will all begin this semester. 

Why carts? According to Justin Miller, a graduate student in How’s lab and one of the people most involved with the project, the carts are much more practical for the lab’s on-campus focus due to their small size. They plan to use the same carts that MIT custodians use so that they will be able to get into tight spaces and drive on sidewalks. We will be able to fit where the custodians fit and “people are used to these types of vehicles being on campus,” Miller says.

The major difference between the lab carts and the more mundane custodial carts will—of course—be in the imbedded sensors that track and collect data about pedestrian movement as well as enabling them to “determine their own locations as well the location of both static and dynamic environmental obstacles.”These sensors are similar to those that major companies like Google and Tesla are using for their automated cars. 

In terms of the drives, the carts will initially be human-driven and the autonomous stage will begin after further development. They will be driving students around East Campus—the area around Stata, Kendall and the Green building—as part of the first stage.

As to how students can actually call up the carts, that answer is “still in the works”, says Miller.  He hopes the team can develop a mobile app that students can use to call up the carts. They are also working on developing a system to advertise the cart transport program to students.  

Once the program begins, the collected data will be used for research to determine where pedestrians are most likely to be at a given time, planning possible paths for the carts and something Miller calls “MOD queuing theory.” MOD stands for Mobility on Demand and is the idea that future consumers will be able to request rides via a mobile app or a similar method and get picked up by a self-driving car. 

“What this research is doing, is saying look: if you have these sensors in your car, you can collect all this information about how people are walking around you and use that information to figure out where [the vehicle] should go to expect the next ride request, Miller says.

“The model of autonomous vehicles being operated as taxis as opposed to personal ownership is a very likely case in the future,” Miller adds. “It’s a good way that these [autonomous vehicles] will start penetrating the market.” 

He may have a point. According to CBS DC, Automated vehicles can get ridiculously expensive, averaging at more than $100,000. The cars would be limited to the ultra-rich, leaving the average consumer out of the loop. Miller believes that self-driving vehicles have the potential to radically change the way the world views vehicle automation if they are used as a ride-on-demand service. 

He says that the lab had submitted a proposal to Ford to use “big data for a system of taxi-like autonomous vehicles.” A feat that would allow consumers of all economic levels to use this new technology, but, Miller says, “what the future holds is hard to say.” 

It is widely known that Google and Tesla are heavily involved in the race to build the reliable automated car. Car companies such as Ford, Toyota and Mercedes are also getting involved and implementing automated features in their cars, and companies like CBC News have hailed such cars as the “car of the future” and hailed that that automated cars are better drivers than humans. 

Other MIT labs are also involved in this breakthrough. Daniela Rus, an MIT professor in EECS and Director of CSAIL, tested out self-driving carts in Singapore as part of the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART). In an interview with the MIT Technology Review, she said that her lab is focusing on creating a “minimalist solution” to the price problem.

What makes Miller’s carts stand out is the fact that he is using them to collect data, rather than refining the self-driving technology and sensors. He says “There’s a lot of data out there and it’s worth looking into to see what you can do with it.”

What will result from all the data he collects is yet to be realized, but it will definitely impact the way automated cars will be viewed in the near future.

“I’m really excited about the carts,” says Roger Hartman, an MIT undergraduate senior in Mechanical Engineering. “Whether or not the carts are self-driving, it’ll be great having another way to get around campus. I hate waiting on the shuttle.”
