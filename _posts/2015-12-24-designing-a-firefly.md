On a clear day in the near future, an aircraft opens one of its flare tubes and ejects a small, streamlined object. As the smaller craft falls away from its mothership, small wings swing into position on its underside and click into place. Then, with a flash and puff of smoke, the tiny rocket ignites and flies off at nearly the speed of sound to complete its mission. This is Firefly, the latest project underway at [Beaver Works](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/), a collaboration between the MIT [School of Engineering](http://engineering.mit.edu/) and [Lincoln Laboratory](http://www.ll.mit.edu/).

“It’s very Tony Stark, it’s very Iron Man,” says Tony Tao (S.M. 2012), a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics who is leading the team of graduate and undergraduate students developing Firefly. On a campus where undergraduates wear sweatshirts emblazoned with arc reactors, the comparison to MIT’s most famous fictional graduate is high praise - and code for something that is both cool and a little crazy.

Firefly is a follow-on project to [Locust](http://www.technologyreview.com/article/522216/a-chance-to-fly/), a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed to be launched from another aircraft’s flare dispenser. Both projects are sponsored by the U.S. Air Force. However, whereas Locust flew at a modest 50 miles per hour, the Air Force wants Firefly to go faster. A lot faster, in fact - up to Mach 0.8, or 80% of the speed of sound. At altitude, this translates to over 500 miles per hour, about the same speed as a jet airliner. And unlike missiles, which typically have thrust for five to ten seconds, Firefly will need to sustain this thrust for four minutes.

As for the specific applications of Firefly, well… that’s classified. “In order to avoid revealing classified information to us, they are pretty vague about what mission it is that we’re actually designing for,” says Matt Vernacchia (B.S. 2015), the lead propulsion engineer for Firefly and a Master’s candidate in AeroAstro. However, he doesn’t feel that the secrecy - which is, after all, understandable for an Air Force-funded project - puts too much of a burden on the project.

**Finding the Right Mix**   
Firefly’s speed and thrust requirements, combined with its small stature - in its current iteration the vehicle is only about 16 inches long, weighing less than 2 kilograms - make for a significant design challenge, particularly in terms of propulsion. The team looked at commercially available rockets, but these tended to be optimized for high-thrust, quick burn times - the opposite of what Firefly needs. They also considered electric propellers (which wouldn’t work at such high speeds) and miniature jet engines (which would be very complex and present significant reliability problems). A solid rocket was deemed the most effective solution, but the team would need to develop their own.

Vernacchia, who has experience building liquid-fueled rockets with the MIT [Rocket Team](http://rocketry.mit.edu/), joined the Firefly project as a UROP in his senior year and took the lead on developing the right propellant mixture. Working in the blast chambers at the [Gas Turbine Laboratory](http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/labs/gtl/) (GTL), the team experimented with different mixtures until they found one that seemed to work well, based on a gas generator propellants. These are typically used to produce pressure for turbopumps, not for thrust, but Firefly is not a typical project.

Unfortunately, at about the same time that the team found a promising propellant mixture the GTL was closed for renovations. Without a blast chamber to mix and test rocket fuel in, the Firefly propulsion team was effectively homeless. Given the potentially explosive nature of their work, the team couldn’t move to another location until the appropriate safety precautions were in place and all relevant paperwork was filled out. “Because of the GTL closing, and because of all the regulatory hurdles, we’ve lost about six months on the project,” says Vernacchia, “which is kind of frustrating.”

Towards the end of 2015, however, the team was able to set up shop in a new blast chamber in Building 37 and is getting back into development. While the propellant mixture they identified in the GTL is promising, there’s still a lot of work to do. Among other things, they need to be sure that the propellant can ignite and burn at the lower pressures that Firefly will encounter at altitude, and that the burning fuel won’t produce soot that could clog the rocket nozzle, which is only a millimeter or so in diameter.

**A Tightly Coupled Problem**
Finding the right propulsion system is only part of the problem. That system has to also work well in terms of the overall aerodynamics of the vehicle, its controllability, structural design, and thermal control - which can present a particular challenge on such a small vehicle. “More so than any other aircraft I’ve worked with,” says Tao, “these things play with each other in a really, really intricate and linked way.”

For example, a major controllability challenge facing the team comes from the center of gravity of the vehicle, or CG. The slow-burning rocket motor burns from one end to the other, like a candle. As it burns, the solid rocket fuel is converted into hot gasses, which are expelled out the back of the vehicle for thrust. As a result, the CG first moves forward as solid fuel from the back of the vehicle is used up, then shift backwards again as the burn point within the motor reaches the front.

On a vehicle that is one-third motor by weight, this CG movement can have a significant impact. The tail of the aircraft must be designed to account for these changes to ensure that the vehicle is stable at all CG locations. In addition, it must do so without too much of an increase in mass or drag - which would require a larger motor and thus a larger shift in CG.

Another problem that must be solved is thermal control. The slow-burning Firefly rocket can cause a lot of heat to build up in the vehicle. As Tao explains, this can wreak havoc on avionics if not properly controlled: “your motor cooking your electronics - that’s not a problem that you have on a normal airplane!” The team is developing an ablative liner for the motor and looking at adding forced-air cooling, with a tiny intake on the front of the vehicle. Each change has impacts that ripple through all the other systems, and the team will have to find the right balance.

**Eyes on the Prize**   
For these engineers, the greater challenge just creates more motivation. “I’m very excited to be working on a project that has a very cool hands-on mission to it,” says Vernacchia, “and that there’s an opportunity for building an entire vehicle, rather than working on a very narrow problem.”

The goal of the student team developing Firefly is to produce a prototype that can do a full flight demonstration. Over the next couple years, the team will continue to develop and test the propulsion system, integrate it with the rest of the systems, then test and iterate on the design. Then, finally, the team will see what Tao describes as “the thing that keeps me going” - that “Iron Man” moment, when Firefly drops out of its mothership, ignites its motor, and takes flight.
