title: "“Portraits and Encounters”, by Gay Talese"
---

Gay Talese’s father was a tailor and his son continues on in his craft: stitching, not with thread but with words, in the same meticulous detail. “The Gay Talese Reader: Portraits and Encounters”, published in 2003 but consisting of selected works between 1961 and 1997, spans the most illustrious part of Talese’s career. Every piece in the collection reads as colorfully as a short story, but sprinklings of detail (“New Yorkers blink twenty-eight times a minute”), along with autobiographical pieces in the latter half (“Origins of a Nonfiction Writer”) remind the reader that this is, in fact, an anthology of nonfiction.

Talese’s presence is never intrusive, but always firm. He hints at the implication of marital disputes and the arthritic hands of Frank Sinatra alike with no mercy. It is a reminder that he views his role as a reporter as one of a craftsman: there to form an image of someone else, but not without imparting his own opinions. This more subjective approach is trademark of the New Journalism of the 1960s and 70s that Talese is credited for pioneering, though he maintains that “it is founded in old-fashioned legwork.” 

For some portraits, Talese’s exceptional attention to detail and mastery in what he calls the “Art of Hanging Out” shines. There are several standalone classics in “The Gay Talese Reader”, most prominent among them “Frank Sinatra Has a Cold”, which was first published in Esquire in 1966 and still hailed as “the greatest literary nonfiction story of the 20th century” 40 years later in Vanity Fair. Never once exchanging a word with Sinatra, Talese nonetheless paints a vivid portrait of Ol’ Blue Eyes, as a performer, a son, a father, and above all Il Padrone, the Italian-hearted boss.

These sorts of figures— private, powerful (whether through physical means or art), often on the downfall and above all, masculine, are the personalities that Talese excels at describing. Tales of renowned Italian Americans (Sinatra, DiMaggio) mesh with stories of his own father as an apprentice in the old country (“The Brave Tailors of Maida”), and Talese’s upbringing in New Jersey, learning the fine art of listening from his mother’s dress shop. Indeed, there is a fragment of Talese in each person he chooses to profile. “I never wrote about anyone for whom I did not have at least a considerable measure of respect,” he writes. As a collection, these brief windows into the lives of others piece together a portrait of the author himself.

In “Portraits and Encounters,” Talese does his best work in chipping away at the masculine psyche. At times he leans Freudian: Marital status is almost always a key to cracking into his subject’s public personas. Comparing past wives to current ones (“Joe Louis: The King as a Middle-Aged Man”) and noting the annoyance Cuban leader Fidel Castro causes Teófilo Stevenson’s wife in misremembering her (“Ali in Havana”), Talese uses wives and mothers (and sometimes beloved daughters, Nancy Sinatra) as foils to the often silent subject. The male gaze is ever-present: women are “blonde”, “brunette”, “petite”, “pleasingly plump”, “curvesome”, “sleek”. 

The rare piece in which Talese enters a female-driven world, “Vogueland” (1960), wades on the surface of a model’s psyche, and it is clear that he is observing from a distance. Other stories also show signs of age: the closing piece, “Walking my Cigar”, is one of the most recent of his writings (1992) yet feels the most archaic. An ode to a seven-dollar cigar, written by a journalist clothed in his impeccably tailored three-piece, is a weak denouement to a masterful collection of stories of immigrants and underdogs.

 Still, there is no doubt that Talese is a beautiful writer, and his handiwork is to be admired, even in stories that show their age. His elevation of everyday details into objects of great fascination achieves the goal that he set out to do at 25: capture the true essence of an era, even if the era that Talese is most tied to is one of the past.
