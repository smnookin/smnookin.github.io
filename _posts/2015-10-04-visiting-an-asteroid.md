title: Mapping a Cosmic Threat
---


Each summer, students do all sorts of activities, ranging from research internships to part-time jobs waiting tables. There are also those, like the few graduate and undergraduate students in the MIT Space Systems Laboratory, who spent their summer days helping to build specialized instruments for a mission to an enormous asteroid named Bennu – an asteroid whose orbit will bring it frighteningly close to Earth. This is no casual, fact-finding mission either: According to the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/), there’s a one in 2,500 chance that Bennu, which has a diameter over two times larger than the height of the Prudential Center, will strike Earth sometime early next century. To put that in context, that’s almost twice as high as the [odds of an average American being killed in a bicycle accident](http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx). If all goes according to plan, the craft will launch in September next year with the goal of learning how we can defend ourselves.

**Student-Built, Student-Led**  
“The mission will help scientists investigate how planets formed and how life began, as well as improve our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth,” said Mark Kahan, Chief Engineer of Electro-Optical Systems for the Optical Solutions Group at Synopsis and a member of the review board for this mission. Four years ago, a team of researchers from MIT, Harvard, NASA, Lincoln Laboratory, and Aurora Flight Sciences began designing the REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer, or REXIS for short. This summer, the instrument was finally completed.

While the scientific objectives and management of the overall project are handled by faculty and research scientists, the actual nuts-and-bolts development, design, manufacturing, construction, and testing of the instrument itself is almost entirely student-led. More than 40 undergraduates and about a dozen graduate students have taken part in the project.  “They’re really getting out there with experience that it takes some people 10 or 20 years to get,” said Dr. Rebecca Masterson, a research engineer in the Space Systems Laboratory and the instrument manager for REXIS.

All of that work culminated in a whirlwind of activity this past summer as the team rushed to finish before shipping REXIS to Lockheed Martin on September 14th. Between now and the end of the year, REXIS will undergo a final round of testing to confirm that it meets 140 detailed requirements before joining five other instruments on [OSIRIS-REx](http://www.asteroidmission.org/).(In keeping with the tradition of convoluted aerospace acronyms, the full mission name is Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security - Regolith Explorer.) OSIRIS-REx is the third mission of NASA’s [New Frontiers Program](http://discoverynewfrontiers.nasa.gov/index.cfml) after [New Horizons]( https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html) and [Juno]( http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html). The New Frontiers Program was begun in 2003 with the goal of advancing planetary science a series of focused missions to explore the solar system. After OSIRIS-REx launches in September 2016, the spacecraft will fly to Bennu, where it will gather data about how planets form, where the building blocks of life in the solar system came from, and what we can do to make sure that asteroids like Bennu don’t collide with Earth.

**Mapping an Asteroid**  
When OSIRIS-REx arrives at Bennu, it will start its work by scanning the asteroid with a suite of instruments to determine what it is made of and how it is structured. This is where REXIS comes into play: it will use x-ray spectroscopy to look for elements like iron and magnesium in the asteroid, gathering information that will both show Bennu is made of and allow researchers to produce maps of how these elements are distributed across the asteroid’s surface. Asteroids are largely unaltered leftovers from the birth of our solar system, made up of the gas and dust that collapsed to form the Sun and planets billions of years ago, “so they can tell us about the conditions at our solar system’s birth,” said Kahan. Bennu in particular has a relatively high carbon content, and since carbon is a key element for organic molecules an understanding of this asteroid will provide valuable context to help understand the evolution of life. This carbon content, along with Bennu’s proximity to Earth and relatively high probability of impact, make it a particularly interesting target.

Once the instruments have examined Bennu from orbit, the spacecraft will swoop down to grab a sample of regolith - that’s the loose outer layer of dirt on the asteroid – and return it to Earth for more detailed analysis. The element maps generated by REXIS will provide context to this sample, so that the scientists who study it will know if, for example, it came from an area with a particularly high iron concentration. This asteroid mapping is only one of the many objectives of the REXIS project, however. “It’s clear that the search for new knowledge that is at the core of these New Frontiers missions provides an inspirational spark in the involvement of students in exciting hands-on science, engineering, technology, and mathematics,” said Kahan. By partnering with academic institutions such as MIT and giving students the opportunity to work with NASA mentors on real-world missions, NASA is taking advantage of the excitement of spaceflight to help train the next generation of spacecraft engineers.

**Mixing Hardware and Research**  
Building spaceflight hardware - particularly for deep space missions like OSIRIS-REx - is no small feat for students. The instrument needs to be very lightweight while still being strong enough to survive the violent accelerations and vibrations of launch, and it must also contend with the harsh thermal environment of space. The project is especially challenging for graduate students, who must produce research theses while keeping up with the detailed and time-consuming hardware development work. In addition, for many of the students this has been their first time building flight hardware. There’s a lot of hands-on learning, but the constant turnover in the team due to graduations presents a new challenge from a management perspective. “Once they become experienced, they leave!” said Masterson with a laugh.

However, REXIS presents a unique opportunity for the students that can make all those complications worth it, and working with students can be a great experience for the professionals as well. “The mentors we’ve had - not just within MIT, but within NASA, at Lincoln Labs - love working with our team because [the students] ask good questions, they want to hear the input, they want the feedback, and they work quickly,” said Masterson. Kahan agrees: “the hardware is built, the workforce is trained, and what a really great workforce it is – smart, committed, and eager to learn.”

**What's next?**  
Once REXIS and the other 4 instruments on OSIRIS-REx pass their final tests and are bolted onto the spacecraft, the whole system will go through its own testing before being shipped to Cape Canaveral next May to be attached to a rocket. Finally, in September 2016, OSIRIS-REx will launch. The spacecraft will arrive at Bennu a few years later and begin studying its composition. When it does, a small instrument built right here at MIT will play an important role in humanity’s efforts to understand more about the asteroids in our solar system.
