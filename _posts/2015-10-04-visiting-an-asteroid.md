Some students spend their summers on internships; others build spacecraft parts for a mission to an asteroid. And not just any asteroid, either - the destination of this mission is Bennu, a big one with an orbit that brings it really close to Earth. So close, in fact, that in the early 22nd century there’s a 1 in 2,500 chance that it will hit us. That’s almost two times higher than the odds of an average American being killed in a bicycle accident. Combine that probability of collision with a diameter over two times larger than the height of the Prudential Center, and you get a one of the most dangerous asteroids that we know of. Next year, a student-built instrument will launch into space to help us learn more about it and how we can defend ourselves.

Over the past four years, a team built from the collaboration of MIT, Harvard, NASA, Lincoln Laboratory, and Aurora Flight Sciences has created the REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer, or REXIS for short. While the scientific objectives and management of the overall project are handled by faculty and research scientists, the actual nuts-and-bolts development, design, manufacturing, construction, and testing of the instrument itself is almost entirely student-led. More than 40 undergraduates and about a dozen graduate students have taken part in the project, gaining valuable insight into the world of spacecraft engineering.  “They’re really getting out there with experience that it takes some people 10 or 20 years to get, which I think is great,” said Dr. Rebecca Masterson, a research engineer in the MIT Space Systems Laboratory and the instrument manager for REXIS.

This past summer was a whirlwind of activity as the team conducted testing and assembly before completing the instrument and shipping it to Lockheed Martin on September 14th. Over the next few months, REXIS will undergo a final round of testing to confirm that it meets 140 detailed requirements before joining 5 other instruments on OSIRIS-REx, the third mission of NASA’s New Frontiers Program. (In keeping with the tradition of convoluted aerospace acronyms, the full mission name is Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security - Regolith Explorer.) The plan is to fly to Bennu and characterize it in order to help us learn more about how planets form, where the building blocks of life in the solar system may have come from, and what we can do to make sure that asteroids like Bennu don’t collide with Earth.

When it arrives at Bennu, OSIRIS-REx will scan the asteroid with a suite of instruments (including REXIS) to determine what it is made of and how it is structured. Then, the spacecraft will swoop down to grab a sample of regolith - that’s the loose outer layer of dirt on the asteroid - and return it to Earth for more detailed analysis. The role of REXIS is to use x-ray spectroscopy to look for elements like iron and magnesium in the asteroid. The information gathered will allow scientists to not only know what Bennu is made of as a whole, but also to produce maps showing how these elements are distributed across the asteroid’s surface.

To accomplish this, REXIS uses a coded aperture mask - a kind of pinhole camera for x-rays, except that it has a whole array of pinholes instead of just one. The energy of x-rays reflected off of the asteroid’s surface tells REXIS what kind of element reflected them. However, without more information the instrument can only determine the total amount of each element that is present, not a map their location on the asteroid. “If you didn’t have the mask,” explained Masterson, “you would just have x-rays entering the bucket of REXIS.” Effectively, it would be like knowing how bright a room is, but not where the light is coming from.

The coded aperture mask allows scientists to examine the pattern of x-rays that come through it and determine exactly where each of those particular x-rays came from. This allows REXIS to map the concentration of different elements on the surface of Bennu and provide context to the sample that OSIRIS-REx returns to Earth. That way scientists studying the sample will know if, for example, it came from an area with a particularly high iron concentration.

Building spaceflight hardware - particularly for deep space missions like OSIRIS-REx - is no small feat for students. The project is especially challenging for graduate students, who must produce research theses while keeping up with the detailed and time-consuming hardware development work. In addition, for many of the students this has been their first time building flight hardware. There’s a lot of hands-on learning, but the constant turnover in the team due to graduations presents a new challenge from a management perspective. “Once they become experienced, they leave!” said Masterson with a laugh.

However, REXIS presents a unique opportunity for the students that can make all those complications worth it, and working with students can be a great experience for the professionals as well. “The mentors we’ve had - not just within MIT, but within NASA, at Lincoln Labs - love working with our team because [the students] ask good questions, they want to hear the input, they want the feedback, and they work quickly,” said Masterson.

Once REXIS and the other 4 instruments on OSIRIS-REx pass their final tests and are bolted onto the spacecraft, the whole system will go through its own testing before being shipped to Cape Canaveral next May to be attached to a rocket. Finally, in September 2016, OSIRIS-REx will launch. The spacecraft will arrive at Bennu a few years later and begin studying its composition. When it does, a small instrument built right here at MIT will play an important role in humanity’s efforts to understand more about the asteroids in our solar system.

Some students spend their summers on internships; others build spacecraft parts for a mission to an asteroid. Not just any asteroid, either - one of the most dangerous ones out there, with a relatively high probability of hitting Earth. It’s also an interesting artifact from the early days of our solar system, and could help us learn more about planetary formation and perhaps even the origins of life. Next year, an instrument designed and built by students at MIT and Harvard will launch into space to help us learn more about where we came from and how we can defend ourselves.

Over the past four years, a team of graduate and undergraduate students advised by faculty and research scientists from MIT, Harvard, NASA, and several other organizations has designed, built, and tested the REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer, or REXIS for short. This summer was a whirlwind of final assembly, testing, tweaking, and re-testing before the instrument was completed and shipped to Lockheed Martin on September 14th. Over the next couple months, REXIS will undergo final testing before joining 5 other instruments on board NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft and launching to an asteroid in September 2016.

[OSIRIS-REx](http://www.asteroidmission.org/) is the third mission for NASA’s [New Frontiers Program](http://discoverynewfrontiers.nasa.gov/index.cfml). (In keeping with the tradition of convoluted aerospace acronyms, the full mission name is Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security - Regolith Explorer.) The objective is to study the asteroid Bennu to learn more about how planets form and where the building blocks of life in the solar system may have originated. The spacecraft will scan the asteroid with a suite of instruments - including REXIS - to characterize the materials that it is made of. Then, it will swoop down and grab a sample of regolith, the outer layer of loose dirt. This sample will then be returned to Earth for further analysis. The overall mission is managed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and the the spacecraft principal investigator, Dante Lauretta, is a professor at the University of Arizona. Lockheed Martin will build the spacecraft itself, compiling instruments designed and built by other organizations.

Bennu is big. With a diameter of 492 meters, if it were (gently) set down in Boston it would completely cover the Boston Common and Public Garden and stand over twice as tall as the Prudential Center. Bennu is of particular interest because its orbit brings it very close to Earth - just 3/4 of the distance to the moon - every 6 years. On one of these future close passes, in the early 22nd century, there’s a chance (about 1 in 2,500) that Bennu will hit the Earth. This may not seem like much, but it’s one of the most threatening asteroids out there (that we know of). Given the consequences of a collision with something as large as Bennu, along with the plethora of other scientific data that the asteroid can tell us, scientists believe it’s worth taking a closer look at.

The role of REXIS is to use x-ray spectroscopy to look for the presence of elements such as iron and magnesium in the asteroid, both to measure the global characteristics and to produce maps showing the distribution of these elements across the asteroid’s surface. To accomplish this, it uses what’s called a “coded aperture mask” - a kind of pinhole camera for x-rays with several pinholes. “If you didn’t have the mask, you would just have x-rays entering the bucket of REXIS,” explained Dr. Rebecca Masterson, a research engineer in the MIT Space Systems Lab (SSL) and instrument manager for REXIS. The energy of the incoming x-rays tells REXIS what kind of element reflected them (iron, magnesium, sulfur, silicon), “so you could know globally that you have [these elements] on the asteroid but not spatially where they are,” she said. Effectively, it would be like knowing how bright a room is, but not where the lightbulb is. The mask allows scientists to examine the pattern of x-rays that comes through in order to determine exactly where those particular x-rays came from. This allows REXIS to not just understand the overall concentration of various elements within Bennu as a whole, but also to map where on the surface of the asteroid those elements are. This information will provide context to the sample that OSIRIS-REx returns to Earth, letting scientists know if, for example, the area that they grabbed it from has a particularly high iron concentration. This helps scientists further understand the results of detailed analysis of that sample in the context of the overall asteroid.

REXIS is a collaboration between MIT, Harvard, Lincoln Laboratory, Aurora Flight Sciences, and NASA. In general, Harvard and the MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science (EAPS) handle the science side of the project, and the SSL handles the engineering with input from the other organizations. When it comes to the actual development, design, manufacturing, construction, and testing of the instrument itself, the engineering effort is almost entirely student-led. Over the course of the project, over 50 MIT students have contributed to REXIS, including at least 40 undergraduates.

Building spaceflight hardware - particularly for deep space missions like OSIRIS-REx - is no small feat for students, especially graduate students who must also produce theses and other research from their work. “For the students, it’s so exciting to get your hands on flight hardware,” said Masterson, “but from a research perspective - it’s hardware, which is a lot of details and a lot of work. So trying to balance a research thesis with flight hardware is challenging.” In addition, this is the first time building flight hardware for nearly all of the students. While there’s a lot of hands-on learning, the graduation rate presents a new challenge: “the team is changing all the time - so once they become experienced, they leave!” Masterson said with a laugh.

However, REXIS presents a unique opportunity for the students that can make all those complications worth it. “The students who have worked on this project will go into industry with a perspective that not a lot of grad students have… they’re really getting out there with experience that it takes some people 10 or 20 years to get, which I think is great.” In particular, the MIT students designing the engineering structure of REXIS have had the opportunity to work directly with the science team from Harvard and EAPS to develop requirements for the system - a step that is not often covered in depth in a traditional engineering education. “That’s been a really valuable part of this,” said Masterson, “seeing it from the whole picture perspective.”

Four years after the start of the project, the REXIS design team has finally created an instrument that meets the requirements of the mission. Their work is not yet done, however, The instrument is undergoing final testing at Lockheed Martin’s facility to confirm that it will survive launch and perform as desired. There are about 140 detailed requirements that must be confirmed and documented, and the REXIS team will work with Lockheed Martin to verify all of them. Then in December it will be bolted on to the spacecraft. Another round of testing of the entire spacecraft follows, then next May OSIRIS-REx will be shipped to Cape Canaveral to be attached to a rocket. Finally, in September 2016, the mission will launch, arriving at Bennu a few years later. During operations, an MIT team will continue to monitor and upgrade the software on board and to work with the other REXIS team members to receive and process data from the instrument. Most of the current team of students will have graduated by the time REXIS begins mapping Bennu, but a new crop of students will ensure that the instrument they created performs its mission.
