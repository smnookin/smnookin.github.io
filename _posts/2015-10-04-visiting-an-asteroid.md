title: Mapping a Cosmic Threat
---

Some students spend their summers on internships; others build spacecraft parts for a mission to an asteroid. And not just any asteroid, either - the destination of this mission is Bennu, a big one with an orbit that brings it really close to Earth. So close, in fact, that in the early 22nd century there’s a 1 in 2,500 chance that it will hit us. That’s almost two times higher than the [odds of an average American being killed in a bicycle accident](http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx). Combine that probability of collision with a diameter over two times larger than the height of the Prudential Center, and you get a one of the most dangerous asteroids that we know of. Next year, a student-built instrument will launch into space to help us learn more about it and how we can defend ourselves.

**Student-Built, Student-Led**  
Over the past four years, a team built from the collaboration of MIT, Harvard, NASA, Lincoln Laboratory, and Aurora Flight Sciences has created the REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer, or REXIS for short. While the scientific objectives and management of the overall project are handled by faculty and research scientists, the actual nuts-and-bolts development, design, manufacturing, construction, and testing of the instrument itself is almost entirely student-led. More than 40 undergraduates and about a dozen graduate students have taken part in the project, gaining valuable insight into the world of spacecraft engineering.  “They’re really getting out there with experience that it takes some people 10 or 20 years to get, which I think is great,” said Dr. Rebecca Masterson, a research engineer in the MIT Space Systems Laboratory and the instrument manager for REXIS.

This past summer was a whirlwind of activity as the team conducted testing and assembly before completing the instrument and shipping it to Lockheed Martin on September 14th. Over the next few months, REXIS will undergo a final round of testing to confirm that it meets 140 detailed requirements before joining 5 other instruments on [OSIRIS-REx](http://www.asteroidmission.org/), the third mission of NASA’s [New Frontiers Program](http://discoverynewfrontiers.nasa.gov/index.cfml). (In keeping with the tradition of convoluted aerospace acronyms, the full mission name is Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security - Regolith Explorer.) The plan is to fly to Bennu and characterize it in order to help us learn more about how planets form, where the building blocks of life in the solar system may have come from, and what we can do to make sure that asteroids like Bennu don’t collide with Earth.

**Mapping an Asteroid**  
When it arrives at Bennu, OSIRIS-REx will scan the asteroid with a suite of instruments (including REXIS) to determine what it is made of and how it is structured. Then, the spacecraft will swoop down to grab a sample of regolith - that’s the loose outer layer of dirt on the asteroid - and return it to Earth for more detailed analysis. The role of REXIS is to use x-ray spectroscopy to look for elements like iron and magnesium in the asteroid. The information gathered will allow scientists to not only know what Bennu is made of as a whole, but also to produce maps showing how these elements are distributed across the asteroid’s surface.

To accomplish this, REXIS uses a coded aperture mask - a kind of pinhole camera for x-rays, except that it has a whole array of pinholes instead of just one. The energy of x-rays reflected off of the asteroid’s surface tells REXIS what kind of element reflected them. However, without more information the instrument can only determine the total amount of each element that is present, not a map their location on the asteroid. “If you didn’t have the mask,” explained Masterson, “you would just have x-rays entering the bucket of REXIS.” Effectively, it would be like knowing how bright a room is, but not where the light is coming from.

The coded aperture mask allows scientists to examine the pattern of x-rays that come through it and determine exactly where each of those particular x-rays came from. This allows REXIS to map the concentration of different elements on the surface of Bennu and provide context to the sample that OSIRIS-REx returns to Earth. That way scientists studying the sample will know if, for example, it came from an area with a particularly high iron concentration.

**Mixing Hardware and Research**  
Building spaceflight hardware - particularly for deep space missions like OSIRIS-REx - is no small feat for students. The project is especially challenging for graduate students, who must produce research theses while keeping up with the detailed and time-consuming hardware development work. In addition, for many of the students this has been their first time building flight hardware. There’s a lot of hands-on learning, but the constant turnover in the team due to graduations presents a new challenge from a management perspective. “Once they become experienced, they leave!” said Masterson with a laugh.

However, REXIS presents a unique opportunity for the students that can make all those complications worth it, and working with students can be a great experience for the professionals as well. “The mentors we’ve had - not just within MIT, but within NASA, at Lincoln Labs - love working with our team because [the students] ask good questions, they want to hear the input, they want the feedback, and they work quickly,” said Masterson.

**What's next?**  
Once REXIS and the other 4 instruments on OSIRIS-REx pass their final tests and are bolted onto the spacecraft, the whole system will go through its own testing before being shipped to Cape Canaveral next May to be attached to a rocket. Finally, in September 2016, OSIRIS-REx will launch. The spacecraft will arrive at Bennu a few years later and begin studying its composition. When it does, a small instrument built right here at MIT will play an important role in humanity’s efforts to understand more about the asteroids in our solar system.
