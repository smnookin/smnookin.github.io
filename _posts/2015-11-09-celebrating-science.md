On a sunny spring day last April, thousands of people took over a city block for a science carnival in the heart of Cambridge. In the War Memorial Recreation Center, visitors wandered through a giant inflatable model of a cell. The gymnasium was packed with rows upon rows of booths staffed by hundreds of volunteers, where they could extract DNA from a banana, make ice cream with liquid nitrogen, or even taste-test cookies made from beetles. On the tennis courts next to the Cambridge Public Library, frisbee-throwing robots played next to a radio telescope while water bottle rockets launched over crowds of laughing children in Joan Lorentz Park next door.

This is the Science Carnival and Robot Zoo, the largest event at the annual [Cambridge Science Festival](http://www.cambridgesciencefestival.org/Home.aspx). It’s the first festival of its kind in the United States, and as the Director of the festival P.A. d’Arbeloff has overseen the planning and execution of this celebration of science since the summer of 2007. She doesn’t have a background in science. Or engineering, or math. But she may be just the right person for the job.

D’Arbeloff has led the Cambridge Science Festival since the Director position was first created, immediately after the first festival in 2007. In that role, she is responsible for festival programming, organization, logistics, and fundraising. Working in a small team (in the early years, a team made up of just her), she has to put together a festival program that will excite a broad audience. She has to schedule 10 days of events, promote activities, and reserve spaces. And she has to bring it all in on time and within budget, which she has every year. But for her it’s more than just business.

“Science is in everybody’s life every day. In everything we do there’s science. Why not know about it?” she says, leaning in to emphasize the point. Even a short conversation with d’Arbeloff reveals a deep curiosity and passion for science and technology. Her face lights up when she describes experiments that she’s seen at the festival, or the eureka moments that she gets to witness when something finally clicks for festival-goers. The stories she tells are often punctuated by some version of the phrase that seems to capture her attitude towards science: “how cool is that?!”

“Not everybody would have been able to pull \[the festival\] off, year-on-year the way she has,” says John Durant, the Director of the [MIT Museum](http://web.mit.edu/museum/)  and founder of the Cambridge Science Festival. He put out a call for applications for someone who could run the Festival full time after the success of the first festival in spring 2007, which was organized by two part-time event planners. D’Arbeloff answered, and even though she didn’t have an expertise in the subject matter of the festival, her background in journalism, politics, and fundraising made her a clear choice for the job.

**Telling the Story**   
D’Arbeloff earned her bachelor’s degree in Communications from Ithaca College, then went on to get a master’s in Broadcast Journalism from Boston University. After graduate school, she became a television reporter - out in the field, covering events, asking questions, and finding the story. Even today that early experience as a journalist is still apparent as she plays the role of interviewer briefly before settling into that of interviewee, asking about my background, interests, program, and plans for the future. Each question she asks is followed by a laser-focused, friendly stare from her green-gray eyes that seems to be perfectly tuned to draw an answer out of a subject.

Her next job put her on the other side of the camera, as she took on roles in political campaigns - first as the national press director for Paul Tsongas’ unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992, then as press secretary for a series of successful campaigns for Boston Mayor by Thomas Menino in the 1990s and early 2000s. Over each of these campaigns, she used her previous experience as a member of the media to tell the candidate’s story to the media.

After politics, she moved on to work on communications, public relations, outreach, and event planning for the Boston Public Library. She excelled at this role, to the extent that when the Director of the Boston Public Library Foundation stepped down the board asked her to take the position. She accepted, and fundraising was added to her growing list of responsibilities. “That was the first time I personally was asking for money, which was a learning curve,” she said, “but we did ok.”

This isn’t the archetypal career path for a science communicator, and d’Arbelof admits that readily. “This was not the original design - how could it be?” she says. However, to d’Arbeloff and to the people who hired her to oversee the Cambridge Science Festival, her background provides valuable experience for her current position. “The thread through all of this is telling the story,” says d’Arbeloff. “What’s the message? What’s the cause? And the Cambridge Science Festival is the perfect example - it’s ‘why should I be interested in science and technology?”

**The Cambridge Science Festival**  
While science festivals are common in Western Europe, the idea of a Cambridge Science Festival was a new concept to many people when MIT Museum Director Durant first brought the concept across the Atlantic in 2005. “I would sort of ask the same question - ‘why doesn’t Cambridge have a science festival?’” said Durant, “and I always got the same answer, interestingly, which was ‘what’s a science festival?’”

Many people first associate the term “science festival” with science fairs, perhaps imagining a gymnasium full of high school students with papier-mache volcanoes and bubbling beakers, vying for first prize. Both Durant and d’Arbeloff are quick to draw a distinction here. For one, it’s not a competition but an exhibition - a way for the community to learn more and be entertained at the same time. “Our festival - and most festivals are - is very hands-on,” says d’Arbeloff, “it’s very much ‘roll-up-your-sleeves.’” For Durant, it’s quite simple: “think about what you know about festivals for art or music, and imagine doing that for science and technology.”

The first Cambridge Science Festival was hosted by the MIT museum in the spring of 2007, organized and executed by two part-time event planners hired by Durant, in order to gauge interest in the community. It was a huge success. Over nine days, the Festival organizers put on 150 events across the city and attracted an estimated 15,000 attendees. Based on that response, Durant and the MIT Museum decided to make the Cambridge Science Festival an annual event and hired d’Arbeloff to oversee it.

One hallmark of the festival is that it’s an event for the whole community, not just the scientifically-minded population. Events aim to attract all age groups, including adults. For example, at one event (The Science of Yeast) a talk from a biological researcher at the Whitehead Institute segued smoothly into a discussion of the role of yeast in beer from Jim Koch, the founder of the Boston Beer Company. At the Robot Zoo, kids of all ages interact with robots of all sizes. At the Science Carnival, hundreds of volunteers staff booths where it seems like visitors can ask questions and learn more about almost anything.

One of d’Arbeloff’s favorite events is Sidewalk Astronomy. On a clear night, the Cambridge Science Festival will work with the City of Cambridge to dim the lights in Harvard Square and set up several telescopes all over the plaza. When people step out of a restaurant after dinner, or out of the T station, they are greeted by volunteer astronomers who are ready to show them the moons of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, or the craters of the Moon. D’Arbeloff’s excitement for this event shines through as she describes it: “All of a sudden you can look up at the night sky - there’s science all around you! And there are these folks who would love to share their knowledge of the planets and the night sky, and you don’t have to opt in to a science event - you just walk out of dinner and there it is.”

**Reaching a Broader Audience**  
Sidewalk Astronomy embodies one of the most important goals of the Cambridge Science Festival - reaching out to the community so that they don’t have to “opt in to a science event” in order to experience one. While she notes that there is a lot of interest in science and technology in the Cambridge community, “there’s also a huge audience of folks who either are afraid of science, are intimidated by science, think science is boring, or for whatever reason think science isn’t for them.”

Bill Litant, the Communications Director for the MIT [Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://aeroastro.mit.edu/), agrees. “Math, when I was in school, was deadly. Science was deadly.” When organizing activities for the Department during open houses, Litant faces many of the same challenges as d’Arbeloff. He also sees the value in these activities. “Just as it’s valuable for someone who is an engineer to have exposure to the arts, it’s equally as valuable to have someone who’s going to be an artist, or an accountant, or whatever to understand a little bit more about the world around them and a little bit more about the what they see and use every day,” says Litant, “and if some of those young people who come in eventually get intrigued enough to become an engineer - so much the better.”

The first step in reaching a broader audience, d’Arbeloff explains, is to bring the science off campus. For many people, a college campus can be an intimidating place. Perhaps they never went to college, or perhaps they went briefly and had a bad experience. Whatever the reason, it can be difficult to reach out to that segment of the population if the science stays on campus. So the Cambridge Science Festival spreads out, with events at approximately 70 venues across the city.

In addition to the fixed events during the Festival itself, d’Arbeloff and her team take their outreach mobile with Science on the Street. This year-round program brings science to the people in the form of demonstrations and other educational activities at schools and community events such as concerts or arts festivals across Massachusetts. “You just bring it into people’s comfort zone,” says d’Arbeloff, “and then it’s not so mysterious or difficult or boring.”

Another challenge is finding the right balance between education and entertainment, particularly for serious researchers that bring their work to the festival. Sometimes, d’Arbeloff says, people can take the festival too seriously and forget to have fun. The balance can be difficult in the other direction as well, however. Litant recalls that during early AeroAstro open houses he would see people tour the wind tunnel and enjoy experiencing the high winds, but would then leave without ever learning what a wind tunnel was actually used for. This issue - an entertaining experience but without the substance - “is something that I’ve noticed and been trying to work on for a couple of years,” says Litant, “and I think the Cambridge Science Festival does a good job with this.”

These two challenges - reaching an audience that may be intimidated by science and making sure that they learn something and have fun in the process - seem to drive d’Arbeloff’s passion for the festival. “I get a big kick out of it when people who think they don’t understand science or aren’t interested in science suddenly-” a smile starts to break across her face as she casts about for the best way to convey her excitement - “you can almost see the light bulb go off, it’s like, ‘oh, NOW I get it!’”

**The 10th Anniversary**  
This spring will see the 10th Cambridge Science Festival take place from April 15th through the 24th. Over the past decade of festivals, attendance has grown to an estimated 50,000 people - and d’Arbeloff hopes to see it grow even farther. The Festival website has a [call for participants](http://www.cambridgesciencefestival.org/GetInvolved/Participate.aspx) open for anyone who wants to present their work, and they’re always looking for volunteers to help with event logistics. This year, the festival also coincides with the 100th anniversary of MIT’s move from Boston to Cambridge, and the Institute has coordinated it’s open house celebrating this centenary to take place on the second Saturday of the Festival.

In the end, for d’Arbeloff it all comes back to telling the story. As she sees it, the festival is an opportunity for researchers to share what they’ve got with the world - something that she sees a desire for in the research community. “Isn’t it great to swing a lab door open and let people peek in and see what’s going on?” she says, “it’s cool!”
