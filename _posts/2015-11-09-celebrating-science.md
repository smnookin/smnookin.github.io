“How cool is that?!”

P.A. d’Arbeloff gets to say this a lot, and she means it every time. As Director of the Cambridge Science Festival, she gets to see a lot of cool stuff - from a tornado in a box to a giant inflatable model of a cell that you can walk around in. And she’d love to tell you all about it.

**Tea. Earl Gray. Hot.**  
I had the chance to interview d’Arbeloff on a sunny Thursday afternoon at Flour bakery on Massachusetts Avenue. The place was only slightly less crowded than usual, but we were able to find a small table in the back after getting a pot of Earl Gray tea, which she prefers to coffee (and I do as well, coincidentally).

One of the first things you notice about d’Arbeloff is the intensity. It’s not overbearing or intimidating; it’s more friendly than anything. I thought this would be more of a one-way interview, but she opened with a series of questions about me - what program I was in, what my research was about, what my interests are, and so on. She’s a very active listener with a whole series of follow-up questions. Maybe that’s her journalism background coming out. While I answered, she maintained a clear, friendly stare while slowly swirling her mug of tea to cool it down. Despite the noise of the crowded bakery around us, the only time she broke focus was to say “bless you!” to a person at the next table when they sneezed.

When we dove into the interview itself, d’Arbeloff proved to be at least as active a speaker as she is a listener. Some people sit still and give short, quick answers to questions, moving quickly through the conversation from topic to topic. D’Arbeloff is not one of those people. Both hands gesticulate away to emphasize, illustrate, or punctuate whatever point she’s making - not wildly, mind you, but just enough, like an expert conductor. Indeed, her dynamic range in both voice and facial expressions rivals the Boston Pops, gliding easily from wonder and excitement over the rings of Saturn to a serious discussion of the challenges of reaching different demographics. Perhaps this is the press secretary experience in her past coming forward.

All of these characteristics are the traces of a career in journalism, politics, fundraising, and public relations which, when coupled with a natural curiosity and wonder about science and technology, make it clear what made d’Arbeloff a top choice to be the Director of the Cambridge Science Festival when the position was first created in 2007.

**Building Blocks**  
“This was not the original design,” said d’Arbeloff, “how could it be? My career spans longer than the Cambridge Science Festival, and I had never heard of science festivals in the past.”

As a young child, d’Arbeloff wanted to work at NASA. “I didn’t want to actually go into space, but I wanted to work in Mission Control,” she said. “I grew up when they were sending astronauts to the moon - it was so exciting, and I desperately wanted to be a part of that.” However, as is the case with many children in this country, her interest in science and mathematics faded as she moved into middle and high school and it wasn’t “cool” anymore. She recalls that she would sit in math classes “and I would half listen to the teachers and think ‘why do I need to know this? I will never use this.’” Looking back now, she sees the missed connection there between the theory and the relevance, but at the time she gravitated towards other topics that she loved, such as writing.

D’Arbeloff went to Ithaca College to get a B.A. in communications, then went on to get an M.S. in broadcast journalism from Boston University. She started her career as a television reporter, out in the field asking questions and covering events. From there, she became a press secretary and worker in political campaigns - first in Paul Tsongas’ Presidential campaign  for the 1992 election, then in Thomas Menino’s series of successful campaigns for Mayor of Boston in the 1990s and early 2000s. After that she moved into corporate PR and fundraising. She worked on communications, public relations, and outreach for the Boston Public Library when the executive director of the Boston Public Library Foundation stepped down and the board asked her to take the position. “That was the first time I personally was asking for money, which was a learning curve,” she said, “but we did ok.”

Directing a science festival may seem like a bit of a deviation from this career trajectory, but d’Arbeloff doesn’t see it that way. “The thread through all of this is telling the story,” she says, “what’s the message? What’s the cause? And the Cambridge Science Festival is the perfect example - it’s ‘why should I be interested in science and technology?’”

In addition to deploying her communications and public relations capabilities to promote the festival, she also finds that those fundraising skills come in handy. While she is very grateful to MIT for $90k of support each year, that’s only a small fraction of the estimated half million dollars that it takes to put on a major science festival. It’s a challenging job, but d’Arbeloff’s past experience gives her a good basis to get it done. “It’s all building blocks,” she says.

**The Cambridge Science Festival**  
While science festivals are common in other parts of the world, the Cambridge Science Festival is the first of its kind in the United States - a science _festival_, not a science fair. The main difference? “Our festival - and most festivals are - is very hands-on,” says d’Arbeloff, “it’s very much ‘roll-up-your-sleeves.’”

John Durant, the Director of the MIT Museum, started the Cambridge Science Festival in 2007 after moving to the U.S. from the United Kingdom, where he had been very involved with science festivals. “He moved here and looked around and basically said ‘you guys have never heard of a science festival!’” said d’Arbeloff. That first festival was organized and executed by two part-time event planners, and was a huge success. An estimated 15,000 people attended 150 events across the 9 days of the festival. Based on that interest, the MIT Museum created the Festival Director position and asked d’Arbeloff to take it and build it into the large annual event it is today, with an estimated 50,000 visitors across 10 days of activities.

In addition, it’s an event for the whole community, not just the scientifically-minded population. Events aim to attract all age groups, including adults. For example, at one event (The Science of Yeast) a talk from a biological researcher at the Whitehead Institute segued smoothly into a discussion of the role of yeast in beer from Jim Koch, the founder of the Boston Beer Company. At the Robot Zoo, kids of all ages interact with robots of all sizes. At the Science Carnival, hundreds of volunteers staff booths where it seems like visitors can ask questions and learn more about almost anything.

One of d’Arbeloff’s favorite events is Sidewalk Astronomy. On a clear night, the Cambridge Science Festival will work with the City of Cambridge to dim the lights in Harvard Square and set up several telescopes all over the plaza. When people step out of a restaurant after dinner, or out of the T station, they are greeted by volunteer astronomers who are ready to show them the moons of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, or the craters of the Moon. D’Arbeloff’s excitement for this event shines through as she describes it: “All of a sudden you can look up at the night sky - there’s science all around you! And there are these folks who would love to share their knowledge of the planets and the night sky, and you don’t have to opt in to a science event - you just walk out of dinner and there it is.”

**Science for All**  
Sidewalk Astronomy embodies one of the most important goals of the Cambridge Science Festival - reaching out to the community so that they don’t have to “opt in to a science event” in order to experience one. While she notes that there is a lot of interest in science and technology in the Cambridge community, “there’s also a huge audience of folks who either are afraid of science, are intimidated by science, think science is boring, or for whatever reason think science isn’t for them.”

Bill Litant, the Communications Director for the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, agrees. “Math, when I was in school, was deadly. Science was deadly.” When organizing activities for the Department during open houses, Litant faces many of the same challenges as d’Arbeloff. He also sees the value in these activities. “Just as it’s valuable for someone who is an engineer to have exposure to the arts, it’s equally as valuable to have someone who’s going to be an artist, or an accountant, or whatever to understand a little bit more about the world around them and a little bit more about the what they see and use every day,” says Litant, “and if some of those young people who come in eventually get intrigued enough to become an engineer - so much the better.”

For d’Arbeloff it seems that this challenge is also what drives her passion for the Festival. “I get a kick out of it when people who think they don’t understand science or aren’t interested in science suddenly - you can almost see the lightbulb go off, it’s like ‘oh, NOW I get it!’” she says. So how does she get these lightbulb moments to happen?

The first step, she points out, is bringing science off-campus. For many people, a college campus can be an intimidating place. Perhaps they never went to college, or perhaps they went briefly and had a bad experience. Whatever the reason, it can be difficult to reach out to that segment of the population if the science stays on campus. So the Cambridge Science Festival spreads out, with events at approximately 70 venues across the city.

In addition to the fixed events during the Festival itself, d’Arbeloff and her team take their outreach mobile with Science on the Street. This year-round program brings science to the people in the form of demonstrations and other educational activities at schools and community events such as concerts or arts festivals across Massachusetts. “You just bring it into people’s comfort zone,” says d’Arbeloff, “and then it’s not so mysterious or difficult or boring.”

It can be difficult to strike a balance between education and entertainment, particularly for serious researchers that bring their work to the festival. Sometimes, d’Arbeloff says, people can take the festival too seriously and forget to have fun. The balance can be difficult in the other direction as well, however. Litant recalls that during early AeroAstro open houses he would see people tour the wind tunnel and enjoy experiencing the high winds, but would then leave without ever learning what a wind tunnel was actually used for. This issue - an entertaining experience but without the substance - “is something that I’ve noticed and been trying to work on for a couple of years,” says Litant, “and I think the Cambridge Science Festival does a good job with this.”

This spring marks the 10th Cambridge Science Festival. In addition, this year MIT will be hosting a massive open house to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Institute moving its campus to Cambridge, and they’ve coordinated that event to be during the Cambridge Science Festival.

In the end, it all comes back to telling the story. As she sees it, the festival is an opportunity for researchers to share what they’ve got with the world - something that she sees a desire for in the research community. “Isn’t it great to swing a lab door open and let people peek in and see what’s going on?” she says. “It’s cool!”
