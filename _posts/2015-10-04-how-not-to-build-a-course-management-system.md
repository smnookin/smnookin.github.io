title: How not to build a course management system

At one of the top engineering schools in the country, doing the homework should be the stressful part – not submitting it. But with the introduction of a new online course management system at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, many students are having trouble with something as simple as that.

The new system, called Learning Modules, has been in development for over four years and is set to replace the old system, known as Stellar, which has been in use for over a decade. But it may have missed the mark. The system has been plagued with problems since its full rollout earlier this semester, with homework submissions seeming to disappear and faculty complaining about everything from issues reaching their students to the difficulty of tailoring the software for their classes. Professor Rob Miller, who runs the User Interface Design Group in MIT’s Computer Science research lab and teaches classes on UI design and software engineering, points out that “people manage to do grading with spreadsheets” and if Learning Modules “isn’t at least as good, people are not going to use it.”

At the beginning of the semester Miller used Learning Modules for class announcements due to the convenience of having announcements emailed out without any extra work. But he’s since stopped using it, due to bugs that resulted in emails being sent with unreadable formatting and left many professors throwing their hands up in frustration. Now, he just pastes announcements into email. Though it’s less convenient, he felt there was no way to keep using the Learning Modules system effectively.

The development team at MIT's Information Systems and Technology (IS&T) department did not respond to requests for comment, but has indicated that they’re willing to listen to concerns - and students have been quick to voice them. Jeremy Rubin, a senior in the Computer Science department, sent a detailed list of issues with the Learning Modules system to IS&T, mentioning the bad performance, frequent errors, and poor accessibility of the software. Other common student complaints include the poor default organization of class materials, and how hard it is to find homework assignments on the site.

The push to develop an entirely new course management system began in 2009, as it became clear that the aging infrastructure of Stellar could no longer support as much flexibility as classes wanted to have. A faculty committee convened to find a solution, experimenting with commercial systems before deciding after two years to develop a new system which would provide “modular functionality, integration with popular third-party services, [and] a consistent user experience” with the existing system.

IS&T hopes that Learning Modules can be an effective solution for all classes at MIT, but many professors still choose other course management solutions for their own classes. Rubin mentions “how concise the schedule page is” in another system used for some classes and that it “is zippy, [with] low overhead,” pointing out the clear contrast between Learning Modules and other course management solutions.

Miller does give the software a bit of a pass, though. “They have to build something that works for everybody,” says Miller. “That’s a high bar to set.” For his own classes, he has gradually migrated away from Stellar, and now from Learning Modules, and uses a mix of different tools to provide the necessary functionality. He’s quick to point out, though, that his is a simpler design problem to tackle. As a computer science professor, he can guarantee that all his course staff knows how to use certain technologies – a guarantee that definitely can’t be made for every class.

And although the release has been plagued with problems, IS&T is working hard to fix them. One professor said that while there are still some glitches to be ironed out, the developers “have been really helpful when there have been bugs that come up.”

Many classes will simply continue to use Learning Modules moving forward, but the problems with the system may lead more professors to take a different route like Miller has. But what could IS&T do to fix these problems, and make Learning Modules more attractive to professors? Miller isn’t quite sure it’s possible, saying that “a general-purpose [system] is never going to win.” But he says that IS&T should start by figuring out what works for the most people, and then focus on providing good interoperability – so that when a tool doesn’t work for any given class, the professor can substitute another tool with no friction. Miller points out that the old grading system made it easy to download and upload spreadsheets, a feature which the Learning Modules gradebook has lost.

Over time one hopes IS&T will work with students and professors to create a system that’s effective for many, if not all, classes. But some of the problems shouldn’t even exist in the first place. With something like email announcements, “you just have to get it right” says Miller. “It should be a no-brainer.”
