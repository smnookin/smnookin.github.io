title: How not to build a course management system
---

At one of the top engineering schools in the country, doing the homework should be the stressful part – not submitting it. But with the introduction of a new course management system for many classes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, many students are having trouble with something as simple as that.

The new Learning Modules system, set to replace the old Stellar course management system that’s been in use since the early 2000s, has been plagued with problems since its full rollout earlier this semester. Students speak of homework submissions outright disappearing from the interface, and faculty complain about everything from the email announcement system to the difficulty of tailoring grading schemes to their classes. MIT’s Information Systems and Technology (IS&T) department has been developing Learning Modules since the summer of 2011, with a redesigned gradebook system first introduced in 2012. But this latest rollout, representing a full replacement of the old functionality, leaves many wondering if they’re releasing the software too soon.

The push to develop an entirely new system began in 2009, as it became clear that the aging infrastructure of Stellar could no longer support as much flexibility as classes wanted to have. A faculty committee convened to find a solution, experimenting with commercial systems before deciding to develop a new system which would provide “modular functionality, integration popular third-party services, [and] a consistent user experience” with the existing system.

But Learning Modules may have missed the mark. Professor Rob Miller complains that the new gradebook isn’t able to adapt to even a slightly sophisticated grading scheme, pointing out that “people manage to do grading with spreadsheets” and if Learning Modules “isn’t at least as good, people are not going to use it.”

Miller, who runs the User Interface Design Group in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab and teaches classes on UI design and software engineering, does give the software a bit of a pass, though. “They have to build something that works for everybody,” says Miller. “That’s a high bar to set.” For his own classes, he uses a mix of different tools to provide the necessary course management functionality. He’s quick to point out, though, that his is a simpler design problem to tackle. As a computer science professor, he can guarantee that all his course staff knows how to use certain technologies – a guarantee that definitely can’t be made for every class.

At the beginning of the semester, Miller’s mix of course management tools included Learning Modules, which he used for class announcements due to the convenience of having announcements emailed out without any extra work. But he doesn’t use it any longer, due to bugs in the system that resulted in emails being sent with unreadable formatting and left many professors throwing their hands up in frustration. Now, he just pastes announcements into email. Though it’s less convenient, there was no way to keep using the Learning Modules system effectively.

The team at IS&T has indicated that they’re willing to listen to concerns, and have been working to fix some of the most egregious bugs. And students have been quick to voice their concerns. Jeremy Rubin, a senior in the EECS department, sent a detailed list of issues with the Learning Modules system to IS&T, mentioning the bad performance, frequent errors, and poor accessibility of the software. He also points out the contrast between Learning Modules and some other course management systems used at MIT, noting “how concise the schedule page is” in his example of another system and that it “is zippy, [with] low overhead.”

Many classes will simply continue to use Learning Modules moving forward, but the problems with the system may lead more professors to take a different route like Miller has. But what could IS&T do to fix these problems, and make Learning Modules more attractive to professors? Miller isn’t quite sure it’s possible, saying that “a general-purpose [system] is never going to win.” But he says that IS&T should start by figuring out what works for the most people, and then focus on providing good interoperability – so that when a tool doesn’t work for any given class, the professor can substitute another tool with no friction. Miller points out that the old grading system made it easy to download and upload spreadsheets, a feature which the Learning Modules gradebook has lost. Something like that would go a long way toward making the system more useful for more people. 

Course management is a harder design problem than it may seem at first glance, and this may go a long way towards explaining the troubles with Learning Modules so far. Over time, one hopes, IS&T will work with students and professors to get the system working better. But the difficulty of the problem can’t excuse everything. With email announcements, “you just have to get it right” says Miller. “It should be a no-brainer.”
