title: How not to build a course management system

At one of the top engineering schools in the country, doing the homework should be the stressful part – not submitting it. But with the introduction of a new online course management system at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, many students are having trouble with something as simple as that.

The new system, called Learning Modules, has been in development for over four years and is replacing the old system, known as Stellar, which had been in use for over a decade. But L-Mods, as it's known, may have missed the mark. The system has been plagued with problems since its full rollout earlier this semester, with homework submissions seeming to disappear and faculty complaining about everything from issues reaching their students to the difficulty of tailoring the software for their classes. [Professor Rob Miller](https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/698), who runs the User Interface Design Group in MIT’s Computer Science research lab and teaches classes on UI design and software engineering, points out that “people manage to do grading with spreadsheets.” If Learning Modules “isn’t at least as good," he said, "people are not going to use it.”

At the beginning of the semester Miller used Learning Modules for to send out announcements to his class. But after some messages went out with unreadable formatting, he has gone back to just pasting announcements into email. Though it’s less convenient, he felt there was no way to keep using the Learning Modules system effectively.

[The push to develop an entirely new course management system](http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/255/hastings_ortiz.html) began in 2009, as it became clear that the aging infrastructure of Stellar didn't offer the flexibility students and faculty were demanding. After two years of discussions, a faculty committee decided to develop a new system from the ground up that would provide “modular functionality, integration with popular third-party services, [and] a consistent user experience.”

The development team at MIT's [Information Systems and Technology](http://ist.mit.edu/) (IS&T) department did not respond to requests for comment, but has indicated that they’re willing to listen to concerns with the new system - and students have been quick to voice them. Jeremy Rubin, a senior in the Computer Science department, sent a detailed list of issues with the Learning Modules system to IS&T, mentioning the bad performance, frequent errors, and poor accessibility of the software. Other common student complaints include the poor organization of class materials and how hard it is to find homework assignments on the site.

IS&T hopes that Learning Modules will ultimately be an effective solution for all classes at MIT, but many professors still choose other course management solutions for their own classes. Miller does give the software a bit of a pass, though. “They have to build something that works for everybody,” says Miller. “That’s a high bar to set.” For his own classes, Miller says he uses a mix of different tools. He’s quick to point out, though, that his is a simpler design problem to tackle. As a computer science professor, he can guarantee that all his course staff knows how to use certain technologies – a guarantee that definitely can’t be made for students or teaching assistants in every class.

Miller isn’t even sure it’s possible to build a one-size-fits-all system that would work smoothly and efficiently. "A general-purpose [system] is never going to win,” he says But he says that IS&T should start by figuring out what works for the most people, and then focus on providing good interoperability – so that when a tool doesn’t work for any given class, the professor can substitute another tool with no friction. Miller points out that the old grading system made it easy to download and upload spreadsheets, a feature which the Learning Modules gradebook has lost.

In the meantime, he says, it's important for IS&T to work out the small but annoying bugs that plague features like sending out announcements. With something that basic, he says, "You just have to get it right. It should be a no-brainer.”
