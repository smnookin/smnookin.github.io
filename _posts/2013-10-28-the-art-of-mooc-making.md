If I told you that thousands of students are dropping out of Harvard and MIT, you might not believe me. But what if I told you they were discontinuing their studies online? They’re part of a recent movement in educational technology called MOOCs, Massive Online Open Courseware, which have been springing up in universities everywhere in the world, especially since the launch of edX last year, a joint venture by these two powerhouse research institutions, to make higher education accessible to all. 

Despite fears that MOOCs will soon take over – or “flip” traditional classrooms, low retention rates on MOOCs indicate that this may not be happening anytime soon. On average, 90% of students who sign up for a MOOC don’t complete them. In an “Early Report Card on MOOCs” from the Wall Street Journal, Andrew Ng, co-founder of Coursera, one of the most popular MOOC platforms, also stated that he wouldn’t not recommend an online only experience over a blended learning environment of both in class and online instruction. Despite the wide variety of strategies for engaging students in MOOCs, everything from discussion boards, audio recordings, to even charging students a minimal fee to boost investment in their course, no one has discovered the secret of MOOC design just yet.

Educators are mistaken if they think that MOOCs are the “next big thing” that’s going to solve the problem of educational access and ineffective teaching. That’s what they thought about the TV, radio, laptop, and iPad, and LAUSD, which recently issued thousands of iPads to schools, just recalled many of them because students had figured out how to hack into them for less than educational purposes. Like any technology, MOOCs will only be as effective and clever as the humans who design them.

As universities scramble to design more effective MOOCs for all kinds of learners, I wonder how designers in any field, not just education, would begin to tackle this problem. John Maeda, world renowned designer and current president of Rhode Island School of Art and Design (RISD), one of the nation’s best art and design colleges, reminds us that design is essentially, “form married to function.” Unfortunately, the form of many MOOCs at the moment, video, isn’t serving its purpose. While Hollywood movies, which can grab our attention for up to three hours, are a billion dollar industry, the average viewing time for a 12 to 15 minute MOOC video is 4.4 minutes. 

Hollywood, the heart of Los Angeles’s cinematic screenland, and other neighboring communities home to screenwriters, musicians, actors, designers, animators, and other creatives foster a community of the arts, where excellence is not driven by percentage points or grades. Captivating characters, tear jerking stories, astounding visuals, and impeccable design bring in the numbers they’re looking for at the box office.  
Technology people and education people are a vital part of innovation of the 21st century, but if you’re going to ask a generation of students to learn from a screen, educational technology will not dramatically transform the world until we bring the arts back into the equation. In October, HarvardX launched a beautifully designed course, Fundamentals of Neuroscience, produced by filmmaker and scientist Nadja Oertelt. This powerful combination of content knowledge and visual skill could be a potential model for a MOOC production team. Despite what critics may naysay against Disney’s discriminatory practices, imagine what edX or Coursera could learn from one of the biggest entertainment conglomerates in the world. What if we could make people cry about physics they way they did when Bambi died? 

As a result of the cuts in funding and loss of arts education, John Maeda has begun a national campaign to add the A for Arts to STEM education. In addition to the emphasis in science, technology, engineering and math education in driving our economy, he believes that the arts are an equally important part of this equation. 

John Oho, president of Oho Interactive who strategizes design solutions for nonprofits, companies, and other clients, believes that four components— usability, beauty, emotion, and meaning---equal lovability. The role of usability and meaning seem obvious; the solution must be relevant for its user and solve a problem. However, in the later stages of his strategy development, he also realized how equally important were both beauty and emotion. They provide motivation and are the “lasting glue,” he explains. They are what stuck with his clients after the product, many times also in the form of a screen such as a website, was gone.

So, how do educators and technologies ensure beauty and emotion, two seemingly incompatible ideas? It’s a solution that must be designed, and a shift in the way that we might think about education for the 21st century.
