Kem Weathers has lived in Boston his entire life. He was here when James Brown tried to calm the city in the wake of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s death in 1968, here for all of former Mayor Thomas Menino’s twenty years in office, and here for the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013. He loves it here so much that he doesn’t even mind the winters: “You just have to throw on your heavy coat and long johns and it’s fine,” he says. 

Rain or shine, every morning from Friday to Tuesday Weathers makes the hour long trip from Dorchester to MIT. He arrives at the McCormick dining hall where he is greeted by a friendly lobby desk worker and five colleagues whom he thinks of more as friends than coworkers. Weathers is the first face anyone is drawn to when they enter the dining hall. He greets everyone with a smile every single day. Even if he is in the middle of cooking, he will pause and ask about the students’ exams, projects, and personal life. There is just something different about how Weathers so is genuinely concerned with all the students and their well-being.

Weathers is in charge of the stir-fry made-to-order station: Every day, he’s the person who prepares the fresh sauces, meats and veggies. There is a lot to do before the 5pm dinner rush but according to Weathers, no one ever worries about being ready for dinner time. It’s all about team work and support. Weathers goes out of his way to provide tasting samples of the sauces to the students to ensure their satisfaction.

A brotherhood has formed between Weathers and his co-workers, Cliff and Andy. They have been working together for the past 4 years and know each other’s idiosyncrasies.  On days when there is Indian food in the dining hall Weathers knows that Cliff will need help. “The dahl (Indian lentil soup) always takes longer since the lentils have to be cooked more thoroughly,” says Weathers. On these days Weathers makes it a point to finish the stir-fry prep as fast as possible so he can help Cliff out. “Having these support systems and inter-personal relationships with my boys is the most important and fun part of the job,” says Weathers.

As a child, Weathers grew up as the third of five siblings. While he was never the leader of the pack he always looked out for everyone. If he finished his chores early he would immediately see if his brothers or sisters needed assistance. This is the same mentality he brought into his first job at Bard, Rao + Athanas, a company that made the blueprints and designs for construction projects. Weathers never went home in the evening until he and all of his teammates had completed their daily designs.

Despite being a dedicated worker, Weathers lost his job at Bard, Rao + Athanas when he had to spend extended time at the hospital after being diagnosed with cancer. In between looking at the ground, covering his face with his hands and hat, and fidgeting with his backpack, he mumbles how after all this he became a drug addict. What drugs? He did not think it was relevant. “It was just bad stuff, really bad stuff. It was a really bad time in my life,” he explains while holding back tears with his handkerchief. Weathers was homeless, in the gutters, lived meal to meal and fix to fix. After a few moments of silence, with a sudden turn of emotions, a smile breaks through on Weathers’s face and he says, “but in 1996 the law forced me to give up drugs so I went into rehab at Pine Street and never turned back, all with the help of Kathy Connley.” 

Weathers met his counselor Kathy through the [Pine Street Inn](http://www.pinestreetinn.org/), an organization that provides shelter and job training to the homeless. Kathy mentored Weathers and inspired him to sober up and make a living for himself. To this day Weathers and Kathy keep in touch and meet up every once a while. “I was once her client but now I am her friend. She is the big sister I never had,” says Weathers. Kathy helped Weathers find the job at the 99 Restaurant where he worked in the back cleaning dishes and cutting produce. Weathers was happy with this new income source but the loneliness quickly set in. When he heard of the opportunity to work at MIT in a dormitory dining hall, he immediately applied. “The environment at colleges is so friendly and everyone is at ease,” says Weathers. 

After working in an environment lacking friends, Weathers greatly values the presence and support of his co-workers. He even spreads this cheer to his customers, the MIT students. Weathers calls out students’ names from across the hall. He pokes fun at their attire and gives recommendations of the best food in the dining hall that day. 

Weathers started by simply asking, “how are you?” to the students in the stir-fry line. As he started seeing similar faces he began asking their names and checking up on their exam and class schedules. Christopher Ford, a junior at MIT, often gets stir-fry in the dining hall. Ford explains how Weathers will not only ask about exam dates and topics, but will follow up to see how the studying is going and how the exams went. “I don’t know how he remembers my exam topics and dates along with other students after a short conversation in the stir-fry line,” says Ford. Weathers has checked-up on me various times as well. During his break he will sit down at my table in the dining hall. Sometimes he is asking about a recent exam or project and sometimes he just wants to touch base and make sure my friends and I are doing all right. 

Weathers takes this part of his job just as seriously as his cooking. This past year there have been [six deaths in the MIT community](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/26/mit-asks-campus-collectively-pause-monday-reflect-recent-student-faculty-deaths/ENpQoJIaXb9n4MpBBeby5K/story.html), five of which were ruled suicides. “MIT is a rough place, but we all need to take time to chill and unwind,” he says. “I call it you-time.” This is why Weathers asks for student’s names and asks about their exams and projects. “As long as they know that there is at least one person out there who cares about them, students may think twice before harming themselves,” says Weathers.

Weathers’s kindness has definitely been noticed. Students who are a part of a cappella teams and dance teams have invited Weathers to their performances, and whether or not he can attend, he always remembers to ask how they did.

Suganya Sridharma, a junior who lives in McCormick, is on the [MIT Bhangra team](http://bhangra.mit.edu/). Without fail, every time Weathers sees Sridharma he asks about upcoming practices and performances. Weathers has even showed up to a MIT Bhangra practice in the dance studio in McCormick to show his support. “He will throw in his interpretation of a few of our moves as well,” Sridharma says, laughing. 

Another student, Arthi Vezhavedan, was recently featured in The Tech for a performance with her a cappella team. That evening, when she entered the dining all, Weathers called out Arthi’s name from all the way behind the stir-fry stove. Later, when she was sitting down and eating, he came up to her with a newspaper and went on about how he is so proud to know a celebrity. He even brought over a pen and insisted that Arthi autographs the newspaper “You know Kem, he isn’t quiet or subtle,” Vezhavedan says. He made sure the whole dining hall knew about it.” 

As Weathers nears 58 years old, he’s cut back on his working hours: These days, he works from noon to 9pm Fridays through Tuesdays. On his days off, he unwinds and relaxes. “Life is hard,” he says, “but you got to work on having that work-life balance. Life is grand. Life is good. It has its ups and downs but there is no such thing as a perfect world.”
