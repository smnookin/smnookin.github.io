Yellow ribbons adorn sweatshirts and doors in my dorm. They stand for solidarity with students in Hong Kong, who are protesting in the streets for universal suffrage and demanding that candidates for chief executive be nominated by voters, not by Beijing.

Tens of thousands of protesters, largely students, have been demonstrating and blocking the streets of Hong Kong since late September. They have stilled the center of the city, which is usually known for congestion and abysmal air quality. The protests have been largely peaceful, though police have used tear gas and pepper spray on the crowds.

A student at Harvard started the [Wear Yellow for Hong Kong](http://time.com/3449449/hong-kong-china-students-democracy-demonstrations/) movement, to show support for and raise international awareness of the pro-democracy protests. Over 30 thousand people the world over have hit “Participating” on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/448929675246041/?fref=ts). 

But besides the symbolism, the response hasn’t been big. No one seems to be lobbying for international pressure on the Hong Kong government.

In the sixties, anti-government protests erupted in South Africa to push for the end of apartheid. I don’t mean to equate the two scenarios: in Hong Kong there is tear gas; in South Africa there was systemic racism and the Sharpeville massacre, when 69 unarmed protesters were killed by police. But in both cases, protesters took to the streets against their governments, and the international public, particularly students, took notice.
	
To push against apartheid, students around the world boycotted South African goods and leaned on governments and universities to divest from South Africa. By some accounts, the international economic pressure helped topple apartheid.

The situation now may not be analogous, but why aren’t we, the students, mobilizing more in support of the Hong Kong protests? Maybe it feels like less of a clear-cut issue. Or maybe it’s a sense of futility. If we were to boycott, we would have to boycott China, directly or through Hong Kong. Would that even be possible?

US trade volume with China in 2013 was over half a trillion dollars. And it seems unlikely that the US would take economic action for fear of injuring the historically rocky relationship between the two countries. Chinese newspapers are already [claiming that the US is manipulating the protestors](http://online.wsj.com/articles/china-u-s-standoff-deepens-over-hong-kong-protests-1413047637).

The lack of mobilization might be due to cynicism about our own governmental model. Here in the US we have a far-from-perfect election system, with parties and hyper-campaigning and corporate influence and a mix of democracy and republic that sometimes yields strange results. The electoral college is weird. Primaries are weird. Campaign ads are probably not good for your health.

And we also have police in riot gear and protesters in the streets: Ferguson, Missouri is reeling from officer-on-civilian violence. So who are we to demand another government to change? 

But maybe this shows a lack of idealism on my part. I’m young; I’m supposed to embody idealism. I'm supposed to set out to change the world. But the realist in me says it wouldn’t even be wise for the US to take aggressive economic action against the Hong Kong or Chinese governments. Cutting down trade wouldn't be a targeted attack. It would have economic and social ramifications in China and around the world that I'm certainly not knowledgeable enough to predict. And with Cold War memories not entirely faded, US sanctions would seem meddlesome: the old superpower defending the wannabe democracy against the big bad Communists.

It's easy to frame inaction as apathy, but in this case our hestiance is bourn more out of awareness of the complexity of the situation than lack of interest in it. We’re not convinced that we’re strong enough, or right enough, to do much more than wear yellow ribbons.
