![](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests#mediaviewer/File:29.9.14_Hong_Kong_protest_near_Tamar.jpg) Yellow ribbons adorn sweatshirts and doors in my dorm. They stand for solidarity with students in Hong Kong, who are protesting in the streets for universal suffrage and demanding that candidates for chief executive be nominated by voters, not by Beijing.

[Tens of thousands of protesters](http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2014/09/28/hong-kong-police-use-tear-gas-to-clear-protesters), largely students, have been demonstrating and blocking the streets of Hong Kong since late September. They have stilled the center of the city, which is usually known for congestion and abysmal air quality. The protests have been largely peaceful, though police have used tear gas and pepper spray on the crowds.

A student at Harvard started the [Wear Yellow for Hong Kong](http://time.com/3449449/hong-kong-china-students-democracy-demonstrations/) movement, to show support for and raise international awareness of the pro-democracy protests. Over 30 thousand people the world over have hit “Participating” on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/448929675246041/?fref=ts). 

But besides the symbolism, the response hasn’t been big. No one seems to be lobbying for international pressure on the Hong Kong government.

In the sixties, protest was part of identity for America's student population. Rally, marches, boycotts, divestment campaigns: youth considered themselves active participants in international politics. 
	
Why aren’t we, the students, mobilizing more in support of the Hong Kong protests? 

Maybe it’s a sense of futility. If we were to boycott, we would have to boycott China, directly or through Hong Kong. Would that even be possible? 

Even if there was popular outcry, it seems unlikely that the US government would take economic action for fear of injuring its historically rocky relationship with China. Recent sanctions on Russian officials over Russian involvement in Crimea have [escalated](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303802104579451142166356328) into sanction-swapping and economic hostility-- the US wouldn't want something similar to happen to its relations with its [second-biggest trade partner](http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/top/top1408yr.html). And Chinese newspapers are already [claiming that the US is manipulating the protestors](http://online.wsj.com/articles/china-u-s-standoff-deepens-over-hong-kong-protests-1413047637).

If policy change doesn't seem plausible or even wise, what's the point of taking to the streets? This seems to be a theme in the American student's relationship with international politics. In Syria, in Iraq, in the West Bank-- the issues are so complex that we don't feel we have solutions to offer.

The lack of mobilization might also be due to cynicism about our own governmental model. Here in the US we have a far-from-perfect election system, with parties and hyper-campaigning and corporate influence and a mix of democracy and republic that sometimes yields strange results. The electoral college is weird. Primaries are weird. Campaign ads are probably not good for your health.

And we also have police in riot gear and protesters in the streets: [Ferguson](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/hundreds-march-ferguson-police-station-26160595), Missouri is reeling from officer-on-civilian violence. So who are we to demand another government to change? 

And so we raise awareness. Instead of promoting action, personal or governmental, we adopt the symbols of an international movement and show our support. We don't assume we have much to add to the conversation, besides quiet agreement with young people like us.

It's easy to frame inaction as apathy, but in the case of international politics, our hestiance is bourn more out of awareness of the complexity of the situation than lack of interest in it. We’re not convinced that we’re strong enough, or right enough, to do much more than wear yellow ribbons.
