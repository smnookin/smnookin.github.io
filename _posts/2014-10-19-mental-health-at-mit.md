At MIT, we like to do things the hard way. We work hard. We play hard. We brag about how hard our lives are. The only thing we don't seem to be able to do is admit we might need help. We do it the hard way because, as a student body, we often don't deal with our mental health at all.

This is not to say that students' psychological well-being isn't noticed by the administration: The Institute was sued in 2001 by the family of a young female victim of suicide -- and it's hard to ignore the fact that, while the national average of suicides amongst college students is 7.2 deaths per every 10,000 students, at MIT, the number is 10.6 for the entire institution and 20.2 for just undergraduates.

So why does it feel like I'm the only person taking advantage of our free mental health services? When I was waiting for my first appointment to see a counselor last fall, I was the only person there. I was surrounded by a flock of empty gray chairs, a flurry of untouched magazines itching to be flipped open by nervous fingers, but no other students. Even as my appointments became more frequent, the emptiness of the waiting room remained constant.

My theory is that MIT students have a hard time admitting that kind of vulnerability. We are strong, self sufficient, and fiercely intelligent. Arriving at MIT is already a blow to the ego for many of us: I was one of the smartest kids in my class in my high school, but at MIT, I feel like I'm near the bottom of the academic food chain. I know I am not the only one.

Add on top of that a culture that's more comfortable declaring “I've only slept two hours over the past three days” than “I need help,” and anyone who does feel the need for outside help is likely to only feel more inadequate. First we need to admit that we aren't the smartest people in the room anymore; now we're also supposed to acknowledge that we feel like we need psychological help? How many blows to the ego can one person take? 

Before I sought help at MIT's Mental Health and Counseling Service, there were times that I felt like I was losing control both academically and emotionally. It would have been so helpful to know others were experiencing the same thing. Imagine how much the stigma around mental health at MIT would lessen if we were not only open to utilizing the services provided to us, but were also open with our friends and classmates about it.

I made my initial visit to Mental Health because one of my close friends disclosed to me that she was a frequent patient.

I didn’t even make an appointment. I went straight after class...and doubted every step of the way if I was making the right decision. I had heard rumors of students going to Mental Health and being forced to leave MIT against their will, and I knew people who had negative experiences there. I had heard it was a waste of time.

When I finally made it there, I locked eyes with one of the secretaries and said “I need to see somebody, and I need to see them now.”

After a blur of paperwork, I was taken into one of the pleasant but dull counseling rooms, where I was greeted by a warm smile and a hug. My mouth and my tear ducts opened simultaneously, pouring out a year's worth of pent-up tension. I talked about my injury from volleyball, I talked about how unhappy I was in my major and in my relationship, I talked about my problems back home, and I talked about how I didn’t want to be at MIT anymore but didn’t know what to do, all while depleting the counselor of a month's supply of tissues. The first visit ended with me taking two chocolates from the green glass bowl on the desk, and making another appointment for the next week.

At first, yes, it was a little awkward, but as I got to know my counselor better, it got easier. We even began cracking jokes together. I never felt judged, I never felt that she thought I was crazy, and I never felt that I couldn’t tell her exactly what I was thinking. I never even got a “diagnosis.” Whether or not I needed one I guess I will never know.

I also never got any concrete answers, which was a little frustrating at first. For example, if I asked her if I should break up with my boyfriend, I was never met with a straightforward answer, just more probing questions. I have since realized that if you have to ask that question at all the answer is probably a resounding yes. Sometimes I wished she would just tell me what to do with my life and solve all my problems for me. It took me a few visits to realize that I was seeing a counselor, not a fairy godmother. Though she was certainly kind and warm, and we were certainly friendly, I don't think I could call her my friend either. It is certainly an imbalanced, unique relationship. She knew absolutely everything about me, though I knew next to nothing about her, apart from what I could glean from little items around her office: the ring on her wedding finger, the photograph of a dog on her desk.

No, my counselor did not help me get my grades up, or help me end my broken relationship, or help me repair my injured shoulder, but she did help me find the peace of mind I needed to do it myself. Nine months and 34 appointments after my first visit, I no longer felt the need to go. I would not hesitate to go back should the need (or desire) arise.

I have been extremely open with my friends and classmates about going to Mental Health. I would miss a team meeting in my lab class, and I’d tell them I was going to my appointment at Mental Health. Recently, a friend from that class actually emailed me for advice because she was thinking of going for an appointment, but wasn’t sure how to approach it. I told her to do what I did: Just go. Just go and tell them you want to talk. They will listen. It worked like a Rube Goldberg machine: Just as my friend pushed me to go to Mental Health, I pushed someone else in a chain reaction of care.

I think if we can be more open with each other about seeking treatment, those who also need the help won’t be afraid to step forward and take it. And with [three deaths having occurred since school started in September](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/25/mitdeath/ScTVxNN3IVJDLpPzMDRLWM/story.html), it's safe to say that we're not all getting the help we need.
