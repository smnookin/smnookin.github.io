A floor below the barking dog, fighting kids, and blaring TV, Professor Anant Agarwal sits in the basement of his home in Weston, Massachusetts. After recording screen-cast lectures for his class on _Circuits and Electronics_, he posts the videos along with some homework and exam questions on www.mitx.mit.edu - a website he initially coded himself. He hoped that this time, the material would reach a few more students than what can usually fit in the lecture hall at the Ray and Maria Stata Center on MIT’s campus. Little did he know, that the enrollment of this class would reach 155,000 students from 162 different countries.

Upon seeing the success of Agarwal’s first class, Harvard partnered with MIT in May of 2012 to create edX, a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform open to any individual with Internet access. These platforms have lecture videos, homework problems, exam questions, discussion forums, and online TAs. Other MOOCs such as Coursera and Udacity had already launched similar models and formed partnerships with Stanford, Princeton, University of Michigan, AT&T, Google and Microsoft.

Though edX started [later](-	http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/elearning/index.html), it was the first non-profit educational technology company. They have since reached 2.5 million students around the world and partnered with 50 schools and organizations domestically and globally including UC Berkeley, Columbia University, Australian National University, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. 

EdX students actually _take_ a class as they would at a university. Lecture videos and notes are released weekly throughout an entire semester in addition to homework problem sets and exams. While allowing millions of people around the world to have access to education, those on the campuses are left wondering how this will affect the exclusivity and quality of an education from a top university. Many students at MIT, though excited by the idea universal education, are skeptical of the effects on campus education. 

MIT senior Christina Lalani recalls her introductory biology course. “There were more than 750 students enrolled in the class but only about 400 attended lectures and recitations since the class material was available online,” says Lalani. She fears that with edX now providing the full class experience the amount of in-person interaction between the students and professors will decrease further. Lalani says, “A big part of why I came to MIT was to take advantage of so many intelligent students in one place. A decreased attendance in classes means less collaboration and learning from one another.” Lalani values the time she has with professors, TAs, and classmates  to ask questions and learn how concepts taught in lecture relate to real-world research. But according to Lalani, “if course materials are available online that means that many students only show-up to exams.” Lalani hopes that with this shift towards online education “MIT finds a way to maintain attendance for courses on-campus.”

MIT Professor Lorna Gibson understands the sentiments of students like Lalani but disagrees with Lalani’s conclusions. Gibson recently launched her Mechanical Behavior of Materials class on edX. This is the same class that she teaches in the Fall. From what she has seen this semester, the trends have not been significantly affected. “On-campus students who are not interested in attending class will usually not show-up anyway, whether or not the course notes are available online,” says Gibson. She believes, like Lalani, that there are still advantages to the physical interaction and on-campus education. For instance, MIT students participate in research activities in faculty labs, entrepreneurship and design competitions, and international and US-based internships. “The social interaction cannot be emulated online but there will always be some students that take advantage of it and some that do not. That is a choice students are free to make,” says Gibson. 

Agarwal, the current CEO of edX, agrees that online platforms cannot substitute for the residential college life. In fact, according to Agarwal, that was never the goal for edX. Agarwal says, “MIT is one of the best universities in the world. Students benefit greatly from attending. Our goal is to reinvent education to dramatically improve the quality, efficiency, and scale of learning worldwide and on campuses. Then we can reach out to those that do not have the means to attend a MIT or Harvard and tap into all the brain power this world has.” He gave the example of Battushig Myanganbayar, a 16 year-old Mongolian boy who aced the Circuits and Electronics course taught by Agarwal. “Without MOOCs, we would have never known someone as smart as Battushig even existed.”

But the benefits of MOOCs are not only online, they can be seen on-campus as well. Agarwal explains, “Currently residential students coming to class to listen to a professor lecture for one hour and then go home to work on problems and projects alone. With platforms like edX, students could watch the lecture videos at home and then come to class to ask the professor and TA questions or work on more hands-on practical labs and projects.” MOOC platforms allow professors to record a lecture and create classes once and then spend the remaining time actually interacting with students in more office hours, lab sessions, and discussion sessions. Agarwal understands students’ concerns but he believes that “given time students will realize how MOOCs, along with this reverse model for education, improve on-campus and online education.”

William Tierney, a higher education expert from the University of Southern California,  says, “relieving professors of their lecturing duties transforms the work of professors by freeing up more time for research and discussion with students.” Molly Corbett Broad, the president of the American Council on Education says, “[MOOCs] hold the potential for serving many, many thousands of students, even on-campus. Students can prepare outside of the lecture hall and attend class to learn practical skills instead of attending lecture for the distribution of information.

Recently MIT allowed on-campus students to enroll in edX classes. These courses were MIT’s first attempt to a flipped classroom. MIT senior Elizabeth Murphy took one such class about the innovation and commercialization of materials. All the lecture videos and homework assignments were completed online. Students attended discussion sessions for 2 hours a week. Despite thoroughly enjoying the course content, Murphy found that the discussion sessions were not always effective. Murphy says, “There were great conversations for many classes. But the professors were not completely adapted to this backwards classroom which made some classes more like a lecture with little interaction.”

MIT Faculty and edX both acknowledge that MOOCs are not yet properly integrated into the on-campus life but neither is willing to give up. According to Gibson, “Many students are frustrated now. But if they work with us and help us improve we can all be a part of this reinvention of our education system.” Agarwal says, “[EdX] knows that students on campus are concerned and confused. It will take time to iron out all the wrinkles when dealing with one of the largest educational changes. But rest assured, the light at the end of the tunnel is quickly approaching.”
