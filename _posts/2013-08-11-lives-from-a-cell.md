![Lewis Thomas](http://www.greatthoughtstreasury.com/sites/default/files/thomasweb[1].jpg)
Physician **Lewis Thomas** was one of America's first prominent science essayists. In <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/21W/fa13/21W.737/courseMaterial/topics/topic5/readings/Selections_from_Lives_of_a_Cell_-_Lewis_Thomas/Selections_from_Lives_of_a_Cell_-_Lewis_Thomas.pdf" target="_blank">his award-winning collection _Lives from a Cell_</a>, Thomas explores the interconnected nature of all living things. "We are told that the trouble with Modern Man is that he has been trying to detach himself from nature," he begins. "He sits in the topmost tiers of polymer, glass, and steel, dangling his pulsing legs, surveying at a distance the writing life of the planet."
