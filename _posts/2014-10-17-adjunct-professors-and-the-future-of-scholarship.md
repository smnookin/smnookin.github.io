Adjunct (noun): something that is joined or added to another thing but is not an essential part of it. Making up over three-quarters of all college and university professors in the United States, it is difficult to construe adjuncts as ‘inessential’; nevertheless, many adjuncts- even those working full time- earn below the poverty level of income. As higher education’s reliance on adjuncts continues to rise and their opportunities for tenure continue to fall, it is becoming more and more difficult for these professors to make ends meet. And their struggle affects us all.

Adjunct professors are hired by a college or university, but are not full members of the faculty. They are usually paid per course taught-- an average of [$2700 per course](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/education/gap-in-university-faculty-pay-continues-to-grow-report-finds.html?_r=1&). Originally, the university or college would hire adjuncts to give students a unique perspective on the subject matter. Adjuncts taught one or two classes, part time, in addition to their full time work in their field. The money earned was meant to be supplementary, not the basis for one’s entire income.

However, universities are increasingly relying on adjunct professors. In the fall of 2011, over seventy-six percent of all U.S. faculty members were in adjunct positions, compared to 61% in 1989, while the percentage of full-time tenured faculty members [has fallen](http://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP-InstrStaff2011-April2014.pdf) from 27.6% in 1989 to 16.6% in 2011. Because fewer full-time and tenure-track positions are available, many professors who want to teach at the college level must teach classes as adjuncts at multiple schools, trying to secure enough classes to get by.


In addition to not receiving the same benefits-- such as health insurance or offices-- as full-time faculty members, adjunct staff earn inordinately less than their counterparts. One study found that the median income for adjunct faculty was $22,041 per year, while the median for full-time faculty was [more than double](http://democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/sites/democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/files/documents/1.24.14-AdjunctEforumReport.pdf) that, at $47,500.

At this level of income, many adjunct professors who work solely as adjuncts must rely on public assistance, [such as food stamps](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-quick/professor-working-poor_b_4645217.html), or their partners or family to take care of their basic necessities.

As someone who is seriously considering pursuing a career teaching at the college level after graduation, the statistics terrify me. 
    
Luckily, there are people working to improve the working conditions of adjunct professors. To confront these hardships, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has been helping adjunct faculty members across the country to unionize. In a union, members have collective bargaining rights, which can help them achieve higher salaries, and possibly other benefits such as health insurance.

In the Boston area, the SEIU is currently working with adjuncts at Boston University, Lesley University, Northeastern University, and Tufts University. The adjuncts at each of these universities are working to unionize and fight for better conditions.

Advances in any field at any institution relies on scholarship from other institutions. However, many adjunct staff, juggling full loads at multiple schools, often cannot afford to produce papers and are not allotted the resources to conduct research in their field. This affects all scholars and pursuers of knowledge, as an “entire generation of scholarship” [has been lost](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/04/the-adjunct-professor-crisis/361336/). On a broader societal level, the national discussion of many important issues has been left to political “pundits,” according to adjunct activist Debra Leigh Scott; she argues that there “has been a dumbing down of discourse across all platforms”. As a scholar and believer in the power and potential in a rich education and critical civic discourse, this is disheartening, to say the least. The world is rapidly changing, and a civic discourse in this discouraging environment seems bound to sluggishness and prosaicism. 

Thus, it is an imperative for all involved-- adjuncts and their families, scholars, and the broader society-- to ensure that adjuncts are supported in their efforts. Though we may not be adjuncts ourselves, we should still support these professors, for the precarious state of this essential labor force for many other universities reduces the quality of civic discourse and dampens advances in research across the board.
