What exactly is hacking? The hacking culture is so well known at MIT. In 2009, even President Obama made a reference to the MIT hacking tradition during an on-campus speech. Every semester, MIT students see some form of hacking tradition, whether that is the Great Dome or the Green Building or other buildings at MIT. 

However, it seems that the majority of the MIT community associate hacking with strictly programming. MIT has such a diverse group of community, but it seems that only one aspect of the community continues to get emphasized over and over again. In Career Fairs, most companies look for course 6 students. A lot of students feel that they should declare course 6 for better opportunities in job searching. 

It is true that programming is a wonderful tool to help make the world a better place. But what happened to the diversity that is encouraged by the mission statement of MIT? The mission statement of MIT says

“The mission of MIT is to advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century.

The Institute is committed to generating, disseminating, and preserving knowledge, and to working with others to bring this knowledge to bear on the world's great challenges. MIT is dedicated to providing its students with an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery with the support and intellectual stimulation of a diverse campus community. We seek to develop in each member of the MIT community the ability and passion to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind.”

How is MIT taking actions to advance “knowledge and educate students in… technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century”? How is MIT helping the students bear on the world’s great challenges? How is MIT helping promote a diverse campus community? How is MIT helping develop the MIT community to work “wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind”?

With these questions in mind, I entered the Hacking Arts Conference 2015 held at the Media Lab on September 26th. The Hacking Arts Festival was held in September 26-27th 2015 in the 6th floor of Media Lab. As I entered the 6th floor lounge, I already felt the creative environment bursting with energy. There were around a hundred people in the lounge, interacting and connecting with each other during the lunch break. The environment already felt very different from the environment of the MIT campus. Although I was not even off campus, there seemed to be some different kind of feel to the atmosphere at the MIT Media Lab. 

During the lunch break, there was a tech expo going on. The expo contained many startups that have found a way to combine the creativity of the arts with the more technical side of the technology. The tech expo was very eye opening for me since I had already began to form an opinion that arts and science and technology could not merge together. As a student passionate about arts, I had been trying to find my niche at MIT, to try to find people who were passionate about arts rather than treating it as a hobby. To find a group of people who were very serious into arts. 

However, the responses I got back were not necessarily helpful in helping me develop this creative side in me. There were no cross registration classes with Berklee College of Music, so some advised that I should transfer to Berklee College of Music. Some people at MIT, when I told them about my passion for arts and the creative field, they thought I was being unrealistic and thought I wanted to do something that was “lesser” than science and math and the technical field. I always wanted to find a place at MIT that I could call home and a place where arts were encouraged instead of a “second” thing to do for fun.

Therefore, the tech expo, which had 13 creative industries, were truly eye opening for me. I realized that it is possible to integrate arts with science and technology. There was a performance by Brooklyn Ballet, a contemporary ballet company in New York, with costumes made by the NYCResistor. NYC Resistor created the motion sensor tutus for the ballerinas to use, which have LED lights that follow the motion of the performer dancers. Also, there was another start up called ArtLifting, which empowers the homeless and disabled individuals through the expression of art to create their own income. 

After the tech exposition, there were many conference panels that showcased the talents from a lot of different fields. The session 3 had virtual reality or fashion panels and the session 4 had a gaming or a performing arts panel. The Virtual Reality panel discussed how quickly the world is now moving unto the virtual reality industry. The main companies in the world such as Google were acknowledging the integration of the art and technology. Also, the gaming panel educated the attendants of the creativeness to the gaming industry. The gaming industry is one of the booming industries of today. And in this industry, art is important in all the aspects as the visuals of the games matter a lot in the industry. To make the visual effects as emotionally accurate as possible. 
 
After the panels, there was a talk by Young Guru. Young Guru talked about how crucial it is for the next innovative leaders to understand and keep up with the technology. The world is moving at a faster pace than we know, and to move on in the world, we need to stay updated and to continue to keep an open mind with the things that may seem impossible. 

It truly seemed unreal that such an innovative conference focused on arts was happening at MIT. Lily Chen, a music sponsorship lead for the Hacking Arts Team, said how MIT is at such a perfect place in combining arts and science, as it is so close to many of the arts at Boston. MIT is just a bridge away from the Berklee College of Music and is close to many of the art schools such as RISD, Massachusetts College of Art and Design, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. She felt that the art community at MIT is growing and that the art is very similar to engineering in many ways. Art requires a lot of creative thinking and problem solving skills. To be successful at arts, a lot of practice and trials need to be done. This I felt was very similar to the things MIT students are passionate about. 

As Hacking Arts continue to prepare for the conference next year, there will be a growing awareness of the creative arts at MIT. Also, there will be more growing relationships between MIT and major art schools in Boston, The New England Conservatory, The School of the Museum of Fine Arts, and Berklee College of Music.
