MIT has not always been considered a leader in establishing campus-wide efforts to tackle student mental health: Over the past decade and a half, there there have been two [wrongful death lawsuits](http://tech.mit.edu/V125/N30/shin71405.html) filed against the Institute [after student suicides](http://tech.mit.edu/V135/N1/lawsuit.html).

As a result of such cases, as well as recent cases such the confirmed suicide of Cara Anne Nickolaus on September 22nd, the MIT administration and student body are working hard to enhance mental health and wellness on campus. Chancellor Cynthia Barnhardt and MIT Medical Director Dr. William Kettyle wrote an email to the MIT community, stating, “By continuing to tap our passionate community spirit and innovative problem-solving skills, we are confident we can make progress and enhance mental health and well-being at MIT.”

However, in the wake of the recent campus suicide, this new push for campus health services leads some to question if these changes will actually be beneficial for the student body. 

The changes include the addition of two new full-time psychologists at the Institute’s mental health and counseling center and one new staff member at Student Support Services. Student Support Services works to help students manage the pressure of MIT through aiding students who are sick, overwhelmed, over-stressed or considering taking a leave from MIT. Recently, Student Support Services has lost the employee responsible for managing the leave and return of students who have left MIT for an amount of time.

Dan Schumaker is a current student who just got back from an academic leave from MIT this past September. He claims that without the person he mainly spoke to before he left, Laura Kajan, his return has been very stressful. “Laura being gone has really put a whole in the community.” Additionally, he has been contacted neither by Student Support Services nor mental health & counseling regarding setting up the check-ins he was promised upon returning to MIT. “They could give me a little more help,” he said “they said that medical would contact me, and it has been two months already.”

Perhaps one of the reasons that it has taken the mental health and counseling center so long to contact Schumaker is that the center has also lost several social workers, including one to maternity leave and one to retirement – which means students are not seeing counselors any quicker than before.

Take the experience of sophomore Jacob Martin. He asked for help in late September, but his appointment, he says, is scheduled for the middle of October. “That is a long ways a way,” he says. Making matters even more frustrating is the fact that Martin had a relationship with a resident mental health clinician at MIT Medical last year, but when that counselor left the system, Martin was left without a support system at MIT.

“It has been really difficult,” Martin said.

Dr. Alan Siegel, Chief of Mental Health & Counseling Services at MIT, says that the search process to find replacements  “is in high gear” and eventually, there will be an increase in the number of available clinicians even though the office currently has one less available clinician than it did at the end of last year.

Additionally, there will be a new, centrally located mental health & counseling location in building 8 for extra drop-in hours, called “Let’s Chat.” Still, Siegel says that the new drop-in hours “won't take away clinical time because the four clinicians who staff it will do what we would do if they covered our morning clinic or walk in.”

Mental health & counseling also finally dropped their phone appointment system that required students to call and explain that they are having problems to a receptionist and then to a mental health clinician before they could see a counselor. The system has been replaced with an online appointment request form. “It lowers the barrier of entry to getting help,” Martin said.

However, there is still a stigma regarding getting help for students who are struggling at MIT. “Depression is a bitch. It makes you not want to get help,” said Martin. Furthermore, students hear horror stories from friends about bad experiences getting help or miscommunications with their counselors that had led to hospitalization or forced leave from MIT. Both Martin and Schumaker say that they definitely have friends who have had terrible experiences with counselors at mental health & counseling.

It was stated in the Chancellor’s email “students have expressed concerns about the clarity, transparency, and fairness of existing policies, and about the level of support for students who take time away and transition back to MIT.” This is in response to many students claiming lack of support for students who left MIT voluntarily or involuntarily.

Martin said, “People have had really nightmarish experiences with trying to come back and with the re-entry process which can be really arbitrary.” 

Schumaker said, “There is a lot of ambiguity in the returning students process, [and] for my parents it was very stressful. They didn’t let me know about my admissions decision until a few weeks until I needed to be back on campus.” He explained that it was extremely stressful for him as well, and that in the end felt like he had to lie to his own mental health clinician to try and guarantee a readmission to MIT. “It was unfortunate that I had to lie and hide some things to show that I was better.”

There is no doubt that MIT is attempting to address the mental health problems on campus from many different angles. Yet, some students are still cynical about how it will work out and what this year will bring. Martin said, “They are trying to make some changes - I’m not sure that they are better and how much is actual sincere desire to actually make a full effort.”
