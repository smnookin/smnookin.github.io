MIT has not always been considered a leader in establishing campus-wide efforts to tackle student mental health: Over the past decade and a half, there have been two [wrongful death lawsuits](http://tech.mit.edu/V125/N30/shin71405.html) filed against the Institute [following student suicides](http://tech.mit.edu/V135/N1/lawsuit.html).

As a result of these cases, as well as more recent ones including the September 22nd suicide of graduate student Cara Anne Nickolaus, MIT administration and the student body are working to enhance mental health and wellness on campus. In an e-mail to the MIT community, Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart and MIT Medical Director Dr. William Kettyle wrote, “By continuing to tap our passionate community spirit and innovative problem-solving skills, we are confident we can make progress and enhance mental health and well-being at MIT.”

That initiative includes the addition of two new full-time psychologists at the Institute’s mental health and counseling center, and one new staff member at Student Support Services, an organization that provides support to students who are sick, overwhelmed, over-stressed, or considering taking leave from MIT. 

In the wake of the Nickolaus suicide, this new push for campus mental health services draws questions about whether these changes will actually benefit the student body. 

Dan Schumaker, a current MIT student who returned from academic leave this past September, knows how tough it can be to reintegrate into the academic community. Prior to his leave, Schumaker was working with Student Support Services staffer, Laura Kajan, who, unfortunately, is no longer with MIT. 

“Laura being gone has really put a hole in the community,” Schumaker says, adding that since his return, he has not been contacted by either Student Support or MIT mental health services to set up regular check-ins he was promised upon returning to the Institute. “They could give me a little more help,” Schumaker says. “They said that medical would contact me, and it has been two months already.”

Perhaps one reason why it's taken mental health services so long to contact Schumaker is because the department has also recently lost several social workers. That means longer wait times for students seeking help.

Sophomore Jacob Martin asked for help in late September, but his appointment is scheduled for the middle of October. “That is a long ways a way,” he says. Martin had a relationship with a resident mental health clinician at MIT Medical last year, that counselor has since left the system, leaving Martin to start again with a new counselor. “It has been really difficult,” he says.

Alan Siegel, Chief of MIT's Mental Health and Counseling Services, says that the search process to find replacements “is in high gear” and eventually, the department will increase the number of available clinicians. To ensure that students reach help faster, Mental Health and Counseling Services has also dropped their phone appointment system, which formerly required students to explain their problems to a receptionist and then to a mental health clinician before they could see a counselor. The system has been replaced with an online appointment request form created to eliminate the obstacles for getting help. The department has also launched a new program in Building 8 called [Let's Chat](https://medical.mit.edu/faqs/lets-chat), which provides additional counseling sessions for drop-in clients. 

There are still forces working against students seeking mental health services. “Depression is a bitch," Jacob Martin says. "It makes you not want to get help.” 
Students including Martin and Dan Schumaker are also affected by horror stories from friends who have had miscommunications with their counselors that led to hospitalization or forced leave from MIT. “People have had really nightmarish experiences with trying to come back, and with the re-entry process which can be really arbitrary,” Martin says.

Schumaker agrees. “There is a lot of ambiguity in the returning students process. For my parents it was very stressful," he says. "[MIT] didn’t let me know about my admissions decision until a few weeks until I needed to be back on campus.” Schumaker says that the stress of MIT's delayed decision made him feel like he had to lie to his own mental health clinician to try and guarantee readmission. “It was unfortunate that I had to lie and hide some things to show that I was better,” he says.

In her e-mail, the Chancellor acknowledged some of these issues, stating that that “students have expressed concerns about the clarity, transparency, and fairness of existing policies, and about the level of support for students who take time away and transition back to MIT.” MIT is undoubtedly attempting to address mental health problems on campus from many different angles, but students like Jacob Martin are still cynical about how well the new policies will work. “They are trying to make some changes," he says. "I’m not sure that they are better and how much is actual sincere desire to actually make a full effort.”
