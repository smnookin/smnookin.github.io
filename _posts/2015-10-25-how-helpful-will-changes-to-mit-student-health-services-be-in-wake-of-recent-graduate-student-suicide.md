title: Changes to MIT Student Health Services Questioned By Some Students
---

MIT has not always been considered a leader in establishing campus-wide efforts to tackle student mental health: Over the past decade and a half, there have been two [wrongful death lawsuits](http://tech.mit.edu/V125/N30/shin71405.html) filed against the Institute [following student suicides](http://tech.mit.edu/V135/N1/lawsuit.html).

But recently, that has changed, and today other colleges and universities often look to MIT when devising their own strategies for dealing with mental health issues. That does not mean there's not plenty of room for improvement, as a recent spate of tragedies, including the September 22nd suicide of graduate student Cara Anne Nickolaus, demonstrate. As a result, the administration is taking new steps to address mental health and wellness on campus. 

“By continuing to tap our passionate community spirit and innovative problem-solving skills, we are confident we can make progress," Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart and  Medical Director Dr. William Kettyle wrote in an email to the MIT community on **TK DATE**. Some of the changes being made include the addition of two new full-time psychologists at the Institute’s mental health and counseling center and a new staff member at Student Support Services, also known as S3. 

The question remains, however, as to whether these changes will actually benefit the student body. Dan Schumaker, a current MIT student who returned from academic leave this past September, knows how tough it can be to reintegrate into the academic community. Prior to his leave, Schumaker was working with an S3 staffer named Laura Kajan who no longer works at MIT.

Her absence, Shumaker says, has made his return difficult. Since arriving back on campus, there have been no regular check-ins despite a promise made before he left. “They could give me a little more help,” Schumaker says. “They said that medical would contact me, and it has been two months already.”

It's not just S3 that has recently lost staffers; the mental health department recently lost several social workers. As sophomore Jacob Martin knows, that's meant longer wait times for appointments. Martin asked for help in late September, but the first appointment he was able to get wasn't until mid-October. “That is a long ways a way,” he says. Even more frustrating for Martin is the fact that the mental health clinician he had relationship with last year has since left the system. “It has been really difficult,” he says.

Alan Siegel, Chief of MIT's Mental Health and Counseling Services, says that the search process to find replacements “is in high gear.” To ensure that students get seen faster, Mental Health and Counseling Services has replaced their phone appointment system, which  required students to explain their problems to a receptionist and then to a mental health clinician before they could see a counselor, with an online appointment request form. The department has also launched a new program located just off the central corridor on MIT's campus called [Let's Chat](https://medical.mit.edu/faqs/lets-chat), which provides additional counseling sessions for drop-in clients. 

As Martin notes, these obstacles are on top of how hard it can be to seek assistance in the first place. “Depression is a bitch," he says. "It makes you not want to get help.” Martin and Schumaker have also heard horror stories from friends who have been hospitalized or forced leave from MIT. “People have had really nightmarish experiences with trying to come back, and with the re-entry process which can be really arbitrary,” Martin says.

Schumaker agrees. “There is a lot of ambiguity in the returning students process. For my parents it was very stressful," he says. "[MIT] didn’t let me know about my admissions decision until a few weeks until I needed to be back on campus.” Schumaker says that the stress of MIT's delayed decision made him feel like he had to lie to his own mental health clinician to try and guarantee readmission. “It was unfortunate that I had to hide some things to show that I was better,” he says.

In her e-mail, Chancellor Barnhart acknowledged some of these issues, writing, “[S]tudents have expressed concerns about the clarity, transparency, and fairness of existing policies, and about the level of support for students who take time away and transition back to MIT.” MIT is undoubtedly attempting to address mental health problems on campus from many different angles, but students like Jacob Martin are still cynical about how well the new policies will work. “They are trying to make some changes," he says. "I’m not sure that they are better and how much is actual sincere desire to actually make a full effort.”
