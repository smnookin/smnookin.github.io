After an 18-year-old student fell through a skylight and down four stories, an investigation was brought about that led to a ban on social gatherings and parties until further notice at frats, sororities, and Independent Living Groups at MIT. During these investigations, the Boston Inspection Services Department found that many of these residences violated safety regulations. 

Greek life doesn’t exist at Wellesley College, but many Wellesley students party or attend social gatherings at MIT frats and consider MIT to be a large part of their social life. So it’s no surprise that many Wellesley students were shocked, surprised, and upset by the news of the ban.

“I'm surprised and saddened by the shutdown of the frats since there were traditions [both at Wellesley and MIT] of going to rush week in September that may never happen again,” said Wellesley sophomore Laura Brindley. “I have enjoyed going to frats in the past. They were a good stress-reliever and a good reason to get off campus on weekends.” 

Hajin Park, a freshman at Wellesley, said that she was bummed that there wouldn’t be any MIT Halloween parties to attend this year. 

“I think it’s unfair because of one person’s mistake everyone else who has attended parties responsibility can’t have fun anymore,” said Park.  

Although many Wellesley students now feel that their social lives are in jeopardy, other students are relieved by the crackdown. 

“[Frat boys] just find ways to get drunk and do something stupid…and partying and being part of a frat only exacerbates that situation,” said one junior who wished to remain anonymous. 

Sophomore Maya Marlette said that most students think frat boys are “icky”, “conceited,” and ”egotistical”. “I see frats as sort of needy, a little gross,” Marlette said.

Other students said that they think that frats can be dangerous because they promote a pack mentality among college-aged men, which can result in dangerous behavior. Many Wellesley students are simply turned-off by the emphasis among frat boys on brotherhood and drinking. 

Most students, whether or not they approve of frat life at MIT, approve of the shutdown. 

“I really like that they were shut-down to be honest. They are currently a huge fire hazard so it’s good that they’re being monitored” said sophomore Maria Castaño. 

Fellow sophomore Seraphnia Oney agreed: “I think it's good that the MIT frats got shut down. It’s unacceptable that they weren't up to code, and that the Boston Police didn’t do anything about it until now. I’m glad they're being investigated and made safer”. 

Marlette said that while the shutdown may really hurt the MIT social scene, it could also bring about a positive culture change at the school. 

This incident brings up several safety issues that I wouldn’t have otherwise thought of as a Wellesley student. MIT frats, to me, were always just houses that I visited every now and then with a couple of girlfriends to “go out.”  They gave us a good excuse to get off campus, put on some make- up, and dress up.  But now that I think about it, those frat houses were always so crowded that I typically needed to wiggle my way through a mob of hot, sweaty drunk people just to get from one end of the room to the other. 

I now realize that these parties were probably nightmares for school officials, the Boston Police, and the MIT administration. In fact, like Oney, I’m a little surprised that it took the Boston Police this long to crack the whip, and I’m relieved that something is being done to monitor and ensure the safety of students. 

The ban on social gatherings and parties may seem like a harsh consequence, and some may argue that it’s unfair to punish all the frats for the misconduct of one irresponsible partier, but the health and safety of students should be the number one priority. Hopefully MIT will have awesome parties once again when frats and other residencies are following safety regulations.
