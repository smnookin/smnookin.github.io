The cost of higher education keeps increasing. College tuition and fees have more than doubled since 2000. The rising tuition discourages low-income students from applying to or attending schools. Middle class families that can afford the tuition are also pressured because the cost can often eat up most of their annual incomes. Furthermore, many students also graduate with debt from college loans taken to pay for tuition.

Dylan Matthews of _The Washington Post_ wrote an excellent series of [blog posts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/26/introducing-the-tuition-is-too-damn-high/) on the causes and possible solutions for this problem. Although many causes have been suggested, I believe that there is only one reason for high tuition: colleges have limited physical space.

Let me explain with an example: Imagine I am a storeowner trying to sell ten bottles of Coke, and there are no other Cokes in the world. Suppose 100 people want to buy a Coke. I can raise the price arbitrarily high as long as ten people can afford it. If I want to give a discount to 20% of my customers (akin to financial aid), then I can price the Coke as high as I want so that eight people can afford it. If people really want the Coke, they will take out loans, but that just means I can further raise the price to match their increased spending power.

The storeowner is like a college. Colleges only have a certain number of spots to sell to students. A college can set any tuition as long as it can fill those spots. The price of any limited resource - whether it is a bottle of Coke or a spot in a college - will always be set at the level that the richest few can afford.

It doesn’t matter whether the college is public or private. Private schools will raise tuition for profit. Public schools will not intentionally raise it, but they happily spend excess tuition revenue anyway. It also doesn’t matter if financial aid is given. Those who don’t receive full aid still pay a higher price.

Now, consider the case where a college can expand without limits. To be profitable, a college would price the tuition low enough to attract the largest number of paying students (but not so low that it loses money even though there are more students). However, in reality, colleges cannot expand endlessly because of the lack of nearby land. Thus, they have a limited number of spots that are offered at high prices. That’s where MOOCs enter.

MOOCs, short for Massive Open Online Course, are classes in which the lectures, readings, and assignments are administered online. If MOOCs could offer the same quality of education as colleges, they could solve the pricing problem because they theoretically support any number of students. In order for MOOCs to offer equivalent education, I believe they should accomplish the following:

_Faculty_: MOOCs should encourage and pay the faculty to conduct research or perform activities relevant to their field. I have noticed that the best professors are the ones who keep up with developments in their field and further their craft.

_Student-faculty interaction_: There should be enough faculty members for students to converse with one-on-one using video chat. Even if each class is taught by one professor, there should be enough associate professors and teaching assistants to work individually with students.

_Grading and feedback_: Automated grading is not sufficient in order for degrees from a MOOC to be accepted by the rest of the world. There should be enough faculty members to grade most assignments. As the number of students increases, hire more faculty. Tests should be proctored by webcam.

_Student-student interaction_: The MOOC should permit meaningful student-student interaction. Students should be placed in online groups, similar to recitation sections, so that they can get to know each other. Classes should incorporate student presentations and group projects facilitated with online collaboration tools. The MOOC should also act as a social network to allow students to befriend other students living nearby.

_Access to laboratory materials_: For computer science classes, the problem is easily solved, as lab materials consist of access to servers. For hard-science fields like chemistry, biology, or electrical engineering, there is no easy solution. The best way is to group all lab work into a few classes, set up a laboratory campus, and host students at the lab for a few months when they need to complete the lab classes. The MOOC would need to rotate students and build more labs as the number of students increased.

In my opinion, rising tuition is a problem that inherently cannot be solved with politics. Colleges will always set their prices to the highest that few can afford since colleges can only admit a few.

Someday, someone will figure out how to implement a MOOC that is a viable alternative to colleges. I don’t know whether it will follow any of my ideas, but it will happen. A MOOC that could take any number of students without skimping on quality would be cheaper for students and more profitable for the owner. That’s the solution to rising tuition.
