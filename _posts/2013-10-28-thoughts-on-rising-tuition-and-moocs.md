College tuition and fees [have more than doubled](http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/student-loan-ranger/2011/09/28/college-tuition-growth-rate-is-biggest-bubble-of-them-all) since 2000, and they keep rising. Including room and board, [the average is $15,566 for public four-year colleges and $31,916 for private four-year colleges](http://colleges.myguidesusa.com/answers-to-my-questions/what-is-the-average-annual-college-tuition?/). These sky-high prices discourage low-income students from attending or even applying to schools and force middle class families to wonder if the education is worth most of their annual incomes. Those who go to college also often graduate with debt from college loans. What if students could receive an equivalent education with significantly lower costs? That’s the idea behind MOOCs.

Although there are [many theories](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/26/introducing-the-tuition-is-too-damn-high/) about why college is becoming more expensive, I believe that there is only one reason for high tuition: colleges have limited space.

Let me explain with an example. Imagine I am a storeowner trying to sell ten bottles of Coke, and there are no other Cokes in the world. Suppose 100 people want to buy these Cokes. I can raise the price arbitrarily high as long as ten people can afford it. If I want to give a discount to two of my customers (akin to financial aid), then I can still raise the price as high as I want so that eight people can afford it. If people really want the Coke, they will take out loans, but that just means I can raise the price even higher to match their increased spending power.

Like the storeowner, colleges have a certain number of spots to sell to students and will set tuition as high as they can as long as enough students are able to pay. The price of any limited resource - whether it is a bottle of Coke or a spot at a college - will always be set at the level that the richest few can afford.

It doesn’t matter whether the college is public or private. Private schools will raise tuition for profit. Public schools will not intentionally raise it, but they happily spend excess tuition revenue on campus improvements (public schools would never refund excess tuition!). Just as in the Coke example, it also doesn’t matter if financial aid is given. Those who don’t receive full aid still pay an ever-increasing price.

If a college could expand without limits, then to be profitable, it would set the tuition low enough to attract the largest number of paying students, but not so low that it loses money even with the increased number of students.

In reality, colleges cannot expand endlessly. Thus, they have a limited number of spots that they offer at high prices. That’s where MOOCs come in.

MOOCs, short for Massive Open Online Courses, are classes in which lectures, readings, and assignments are administered online. Unlike colleges, MOOCs can easily expand to support any number of students. Without a cap on the students admitted, MOOCs can increase profits by charging lower tuition to attract the largest number of students. The MOOCs that charge a lower tuition would be a viable solution to the problem if they offered the same quality of education as colleges. 

In order for MOOCs to offer equivalent education, I believe they should accomplish the following:

_Faculty_: MOOCs should encourage and pay faculty members to conduct research in or perform activities relevant to their fields. The best professors I’ve had are ones who kept up with developments in their field and furthered their craft while teaching.

_Student-faculty interaction_: There should be enough faculty members for students to converse with one-on-one using video chat. Even if each class is taught by one professor, there should be enough associate professors and teaching assistants to work individually with students.

_Grading and feedback_: Grading should be done the traditional way so that concerns about the grading process don’t bring into question the validity of diplomas. There should be enough faculty members to grade most assignments. As the number of students increases, the number of professors and TAs should increase with it. Tests should be proctored by webcam.

_Student-student interaction_: MOOCs should permit meaningful student-student interaction. Students should be placed in online groups, similar to recitation sections, so that they can get to know each other. Classes should incorporate student presentations and group projects facilitated by video chat and other collaboration tools. MOOCs should also act as social networks that allow students to befriend other students living nearby.

_Access to laboratory materials_: For computer science classes, the problem is easily solved, as lab materials consist of access to servers. For hard-science fields like chemistry, biology, or electrical engineering, there is no easy solution. The best way is to group all lab work into a few classes, set up a small campus devoted entirely to lab space and student housing, and host students at the labs for a few months when they need to complete the lab classes. The MOOC would need to rotate students and build more “lab campuses” as the number of students increased.

Many argue that MOOCs could never offer the same level of education. I agree with them to a certain extent: MOOCs _as currently implemented or envisioned_ cannot match up with colleges. I am proposing an entirely new kind of MOOC that could offer the same education.

Many have suggested [political solutions](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/06/the-tuition-is-too-damn-high-part-x-so-how-do-we-fix-it/) to the problem of rising tuition. President Obama even promised to make college more affordable. In my opinion, rising tuition inherently cannot be solved with politics. Colleges will always set their prices to the highest that few can afford since colleges can only admit a few.

Someday, someone will figure out how to implement a MOOC that is a viable alternative to colleges. A MOOC could charge lower tuition but attract enough students to be financially sustainable. If it incorporates some of the ideas suggested above, the quality of education would be no different from that of a college. MOOCs will be the solution to rising tuition.
