"Topics and Methods in 21st Century Journalism," listed in MIT's course catalog as 21W/737/CMS.350/CMS.850, is a new course being offered during the fall semester of 2013. The course was designed by Seth Mnookin and the website was created by Mnookin and [HyperStudio's Jamie Folsom](http://hyperstudio.mit.edu/people/), with assistance from [MIT Graduate Program in Science Writing](http://sciwrite.mit.edu/) graduates Zahra Hirji, Aviva Rutkin, and Erin Weeks. 

The development of the course was aided by a generous grant from MIT's [Alumni Class Funds](http://web.mit.edu/alumnifunds/), which was founded in 1994 with support from MIT alumni from the classes of 1951, 1955, 1972, and 1999. The Alumni Funds are intended as seed money for new, "high risk" initiatives that encourage creative curriculum and teaching changes, improve the quality of teaching, and enrich the learning experience, including the imaginative use of technology and applications. A list of other projects funded for the 2013-2014 academic year can be found [here](http://web.mit.edu/alumnifunds/awards/ay13-14.html).
