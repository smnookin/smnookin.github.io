We have seen this scene in classrooms before. “Pay attention,” the teacher says at the child looking out the window. She believes the student is bored, disengaged, and focusing his or her attention on something other than the lesson, definitely not learning the material on the board. 

This is how we might have thought about education ten or twenty years ago. But could all that be changing? 

“Attention has a second dimension,” says Joanna Christodoulou, co-author of a recent study from the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Lab at MIT and the University of Southern California. While Christodoulou is certainly not advocating that daydreaming should be part of a revamped school curriculum, students may find that in a fast paced media world with a constant stream of tweets and texts, they may the lack time to turn their external devices off and their own reflective thinking on.

The time seemingly “doing nothing” is more important than it looks. We usually think of “paying attention” as directing our attention outwardly, but we actually activate another part of the brain called the “default mode” that focuses our attention inward when we are restfully awake, envisioning the future, considering the thoughts of others, or reflecting on the past. Like decades of sleep research that found that brain does not turn off even after we are asleep, studies on cognitive development have shown that even as one’s thoughts wander, the brain is not inattentive. In fact, researchers studying this wakeful yet resting “default mode” of the brain have found the exact opposite. 

Ironically, the discovery of the brain’s default network was purely accidental, as neuroscientists normally conducted experiments to study the brain in an active state, such as solving a math problem or playing an instrument. As a result, although scientists had been collecting data on the brain’s default mode as an experimental control since the invention of the first brain scanning machines in the 1990s, this information was largely ignored until 2001 when researchers Raichle, Gusnard, and their colleagues observed shared patterns in all participants and recognized brain activity in the default network as distinct from other states.

The default mode plays a critical role in developing our social and emotional skills and well-being, especially in our moral judgments and our understanding of ourselves and other people, and relates to scores on an intelligence test. Students who turn their attention outward all the time are not better learners, explains Christodoulou. In fact, they may be at a disadvantage in their ability to disengage from the outside world and engage with their internal focus system.

Today, between tweeting, texting, television, and a barrage of other inputs from various digital devices, there is never a dull moment for children growing up in a 21st century media world. Because the brain’s goal oriented, active state and the default mode, a brain system much like the motor system or visual system, alternate like a see saw, depending on where our attention is directed, Christodoulou wonders about the future of a generation of children growing up in a world where their attention, due to the demands of media, home, and school, are constantly driven outwards. 

Researchers have already reported negative effects on children who must constantly sustain their attention outward, such as those who grow up in violent neighborhoods who must keep a constant, vigilant watch. Can social media have similar negative effects on social and emotional development?

According to Christodoulou, preliminary research supports the observation that more time spent on social media is linked to less empathy to people who are not part of their own social group. Furthermore, some research suggests that texting, the most common way teens communicate in developed nations since 2010, may make young people value more external or materialistic things at the expense of their own inner thoughts and beliefs. 

An article recently published by the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California titled, “Tweet this: Rapid fire media may confuse your moral compass,” suggests the speed at which news, media, and communication moves is already faster than we can fully process them. Brain imaging showed that participants needed at least six to eight seconds to respond to social pain, much longer than the response time for signs of physical pain in others. This makes sense as mental processing that occurs through the brain’s default mode, such as moral decision making, require more time for internal thought and reflection.

Appreciation of findings about the default mode could also inform policies that affect educators and schools, as studies have already found that trainings, such as meditation with children, aided their ability to focus, sustain attention, and stay on task. 

Based on these initial investigations, Christodoulou calls for further research to study how recent changes in media’s role in society and demands on our attention affect internal processes in which humans are able to sympathize with others and make meaning of the outside world.
