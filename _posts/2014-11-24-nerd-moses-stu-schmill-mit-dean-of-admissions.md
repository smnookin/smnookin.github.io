Stu Schmill is a nerd. I say this as the utmost compliment. Frameless rectangular glasses that remind me of my dad perch on his nose beneath dark, thick, active eyebrows that bounce and jump on his forehead like electrons in an excited state. A grey striped suit and blue tie hang on his slight frame. It is his small stature, packed dense with a buzzing energy, the glasses, and his peppered black hair that have caused many to tell Stu, an MIT alumnus and the current Dean of Admissions, that he reminds them of Stephen Colbert. “I myself never would have made that comparison, but I decided to go with it. Now every year at the admissions season kickoff I do one of those “The Word” segments like from [The Colbert Report],” said Stu. 

In “The Word” segment, Colbert sets up the joke speaking into the camera on one half of the screen, while the punch-line pops up on the other half, that appears to be a blue column similar to that used in news shows. 
Two of Stu’s favorite kickoff jokes go:

“Admissions officers have told students and parents that we like students who do community service, and so almost all of our applicants have now done community service. So we have to speak wisely…
 [Next: “We love students who can bake cookies!”]

“...In closing, I want to bring it back to today’s word, TEAM. Remember our motto: there is no I in team”
 [On screen: but there is an M and E]

The admissions team took the  Stu-Stephen comparison even further when they created a response video to a Colbert Report episode that jokingly knocked MIT by comparing it to a higher end training school.

Richard Hirsch was on the Colbert Report to talk about the state of education in the US. He mentioned that MIT was an example of universities who were doing higher education correctly. Colbert, in his caricature’s signature feigned ignorance, said, “MIT? That’s just a tech school. It’s basically the Harvard of DeVry’s.”

The response video, titled “Stu Puts Stephen on Notice” shows Stu watching the clip of this transgression against nerd mecca on a massive mounted monitor from behind his desk in the admissions office. With the wave of a hand that wields the power of the MIT tech geek, he dismisses the video from the screen. Stu slowly swivels in his chair to face the camera, which briefly cuts in on Stu’s flashing gold “Brass Rat,” MIT’s iconic class ring. 

“Hello, Stephen,” he said to his doppelganger, “I’m Stu Schmill.”

“It is clear that you have a lot to learn about MIT…”
**Camera angle change**
 “Which brings us to tonight’s Word: Education”

Though Stu hasn’t had the many years of improvisational comedy training that Stephen completed at Second City in Chicago, Stu possesses tremendous comedic chops, emulating the Colbert cadence and tone with ease. Stu then goes on to defend MIT’s nerdy honor. “You may call us just a tech school or, The Harvard of DeVry’s,” Stu said, “Big words coming from the Jon Stewart of DeVry’s.”

He goes on to further poke fun at The Colbert Report host, saying that if Stephen were to apply to MIT, his application would make a worthy contender… for his shredder. “My favorite joke from that video was when we pulled up ‘MIT nation > Colbert Nation’ on the screen,’” said Stu. “Colbert himself is a genius and I am obviously not even in the same ballpark as him but that’s the kind of humor I like. Relatively dry and makes you think. I had a lot of fun making it!”

This goofiness, this ability to poke fun at others and himself is one of the things that distinguish Stu from other Deans of Admissions and administrators. Chris Peterson, an assistant director in the Admissions Office, is the one who pitched the video idea to bring more attention to the Admissions Blog. “A lot of admissions deans wouldn’t go for [being in a video like this] because it would make them look foolish. You have to be this inhuman, inhumane decider of things. Ultimately you’re making these decisions and you don’t want people to think human foibles or weakness are being introduced to that. One thing we definitely try to do with the blogs, videos, and other things is to say no, we’re people… we care and we have a human side that we want to promote. Stu was like, ‘Is mimicking Stephen Colbert the most dignified thing that a dean could do? No!’ But Stu doesn’t engage in this shallow conception of hollow dignity. He doesn’t hide behind pomp and circumstance. He doesn’t insist that people introduce him or address him as Dean Schmill. He manages to command that kind of respect just by being who he is.”

I don’t think Stu quite understands that I am writing a piece about him, even though I tried to emphasize that the profile was narrowly about him and his experiences. He consistently qualified his statements as from “[his] own myopic perspective.” He is so humble that he couldn’t understand that it is precisely his myopic perspective that I want to know about. It is also nearly impossible to get Stu to talk about himself, he always manages to steer the conversation back to MIT or to admissions. This is probably due to the fact that they are in the peak of application reading season, making critical admissions decisions before early action acceptance letters go out in a few weeks. I half expected him to break into the pitch designed to lure glassy eyed high school student to apply to MIT, even though I am already a student there. The pitch convinced me long ago.


II. Stu Schmill, a History of 90 degree turns

Stu’s path to Dean of admissions looks more like the back of a circuit board, with dead ends and 90 degree turns, than the simple or straight trajectory experienced by most in the admissions world. 

Stu started out as a happy kid in a small apartment in Queens, New York. He seemed more on the path to being a jock than a science nerd, playing stickball and paddleball with the other kids, progressing to golf, tennis, and little league baseball. “Growing up in New York was great,” Stu said, “all my friends were in the neighborhood and we would all just hang out. That was kinda all we did! I don’t remember there ever being strict schedules.” 

Math and science were always among Stu’s strengths, but they didn’t become a part of his identity until a 9th grade trip to the Museum of Natural History… 

“I didn’t consider myself a math and science person, because academically I just thought of myself as going to school. I did OK in some things and better in others but I wasn’t thinking of what it would lead to. Over Christmas break, we had an assignment to go to the Museum of Natural History, which is awesome. We had to go through the prehistory section that starts with the slimy insects and goes all the way through mammals and so on. Then we had to answer questions about it and I just thought it was super interesting. The next year in tenth grade English, we were assigned Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis. This book is about a scientist who goes into public health. It was all about this scientific quest to make the world better through scientific research. That was the first time I connected what was happening in school in a math/science way to what you might do in the world, I found it compelling. I started then thinking about science and I joined the Junior Academy of Sciences in the Upper East Side. And then I started taking a bunch of AP science classes then started computer programming and all of that stuff.”

His interest in these subjects caused him to focus on “sciencey” schools when he began applying to colleges. His parents, who had never attended college, didn’t push him on the matter and mostly left him to his own devices when looking at schools. They supported him in whatever he wanted. MIT did not make it onto his radar until his senior year of high school. How ironic that the man to one day lead MIT’s admissions doesn’t even remember how he heard about MIT or what his thoughts on the school were before he applied. College was such a foreign world to him that he probably didn’t give much more than a casual thought. “I remember being quite shocked that I got in to MIT. I applied, just like if you walk by a slot machine and toss a coin in,” said Stu, “I honestly had no idea. I had my own little world in the Park Section of Queens. I had no way to calibrate what I was doing. I just thought I was doing fine in school.”


Once he was actually on campus, Stu didn’t exactly fall in love with MIT as an institution. “MIT was a shock. I was very proud of getting in, and then once I got here I had a definite adjustment. It didn’t happen very often in high school where they’d go through things I didn’t understand. So that part that MIT students experience, where you have to say I don’t get this and I need help, was definitely terrifying for me,” he said. There was less student support to ensure that once admitted, people were able to succeed. Students had more independence, autonomy, freedom and less supervision. The drinking age at the time was lower, so there were fewer issues of liability or safety. To a certain extent, they probably weren’t involved because they didn’t have to be. The administration also didn’t send the message that they cared too much about the students’ happiness and wellbeing. A popular phrase used around MIT today is “IHTFP”, which represents the love/hate relationship students have with the Institute. It can be interpreted to stand for “I have truly found paradise,” or “I hate this fucking place.” According to Stu, this phrase didn’t exist when he was an undergrad because no one saw MIT as a paradise.  

“IHTFP back then would have been much more skewed to the hate side.”

In fact, Stu and his friends probably never would have guessed he would go on to be such an essential part of the MIT faculty, as he didn’t even pay attention to who was on his class council. If you had asked him and his friends about the MIT administration, they probably would have shrugged and said they didn’t know anything about it. Instead, the crew team and New House, an MIT dorm, were the two most prominent communities in Stu’s college experience. His favorite memories of MIT are all from his time as a coxswain, “you know, the little guy in the back of the boat who yells at everyone?” There is a longstanding crew tradition where the victorious crew throws their coxswain in the water after the race: 

“Unfortunately I didn’t get thrown in all that often. We did manage to win a few races. We were down at Columbia racing them and we won. I remember getting thrown into the East River, which was… not good. I was sick a week after that, just from who knows what might have came in through… various ways. We were actually decent that year, and at Coast Guard they wouldn’t let them throw me in because there had been an oil spill in the water. The team was gonna do it anyway but they stationed somebody there to prevent it, so they waited to throw me in the Charles River after we got back to Boston.”

Stu majored in Course 2, nerd-speak for mechanical engineering. He relates to the feelings that many MIT students feel once they arrive, that MIT was meant for the insanely smart, the gods of geekdom. “Academics wise I did ok. I did fine,” Stu said, “I ended up using my MIT mechanical engineering background for a little bit which was all well and good but that’s not how I define my MIT experience. Most of the energy that comes back to you when you commit to things came from my teammates at the boathouse and my living group more so than my actual classes.” 

After graduating, Stu moved to Detroit to work for GM as a project or release engineer. He was both relieved, but also seemed slightly disappointed, to not have to face any more free body diagrams (a common tool for any mechanical engineer), or formulas. Instead, he engineered people and the interactions of different groups. He expected to graduate and do a lot of analysis, but instead he was charged with making sure 200 different car parts were adequately created, tested, and finished by different teams. “I didn’t really feel like had to do anything other than organize people and make sure these parts were made right and worked. They were all these other teams that had to actually do all the work and my role was just kind of in the center of it all.”

90 Degree Turn #1:
Stu is a social creature. To make more friends and meet people in his new city, he went down to the Detroit Boat Club, where they asked if he would be interested in coaching high school students. After a year there, he took a crew to the National Championships. While there, Stu bumped into his old MIT coach, who he discovered was soon to leave MIT crew in favor of Berkeley crew. A few weeks later, Stu got the call asking if he would be interesting in coming back to MIT to coach the freshmen. “At first I laughed and said, ‘oh I would love to, that would be great, but I live in Detroit and I have a job.’ Then I thought about it. I was 22 or 23 at the time, and if ever I was gonna make a move like this now would be the time to do it. So I did it. I quit my job and moved back here and started coaching.” 

90 Degree Turn #2:
After three years, Stu became the director of the boathouse. It became a possibility that he would be a coach forever because he just loved it so much. However, when his daughter was born, he realized that coaching crew was keeping him from his family. Crew demands that you be in the boathouse in the mornings, the afternoons, the weekends and throughout the summer, so he began considering other options. An expensive sport due to the funding for the maintenance and transportation of the boats and equipment, crew requires that coaches not only guide their teams and recruit athletes for the next season, but also raise funds to keep their programs running. When a fundraising job opened up in the Alumni Office, Stu decided to go for it. 

90 Degree Turn #3:
After getting the job in the Alumni Office, filling the role for two and a half years, Stu moved to admissions to run the Alumni Interviewing Program, which he ran for 5 years. Over this period, Stu began to have the relationship with MIT that he lacked as an undergrad. The institution became more human in terms of caring for its students.

90 Degree Turn #4:
Marilee Jones had been the MIT dean of admissions for 10 years when she suddenly resigned. It had come to light that she fabricated her educational credentials on her resumee when applying for the entry-level admissions job 28 years prior. She did not correct her resumee when applying for the position as dean. Stu was appointed interim dean amidst the turmoil. “The hardest part was not so much our reputation outside, but was trying to help the admission office go forward when we lost someone we had loved and then was just abruptly taken away,” said Stu, “Marilee was a part of us and we really loved her. And on top of everything there was this big search and we were in the middle of admissions season. It was awkward because I was interim while also applying for the job. I developed a much deeper appreciation for students waiting to get in or not because I was waiting to hear what would ultimately happen. So maybe it was almost an appropriate introduction to the job.”

III. Dean Stu

Stu likes to do the whole dean thing a little differently. “I am a relative late comer to the admissions world. Before I applied for this job I only had 5 years of experience. People at other places started as admissions counselors working for decades in the field, and so they probably feel more traditional about the mechanics of admissions whereas I don’t feel as beholden to those traditions. I really like our attitude in that we think we are gonna do not necessarily what has been done in the past but more what makes sense to us. For example we don’t use the common app, but most selective schools use it. Georgetown is the only other school in our peer set that doesn’t use the common app. We don’t do things differently just to be different but we do it because it makes sense to us,” said Stu.

He is hardly a conventional dean. I can speak to this anecdotally. I was admitted to a couple schools that are about the same level academically as MIT, and I attended their campus preview weekends, where admitted students spend the weekend at the school to meet other admitted students and taste that school’s experience. From all the campus preview weekends I went to, the only speaker I remember was Stu. He represented to me, and still does, all the good things about MIT. The enthusiasm, the clever wit, the embrace of his own nerdness all seemed to be quintessential to the Institute. He is genuinely engaged when talking to an audience. “He presented an award at the FIRST Robotics Competition. Not to be unfair, but before him, it was all these corporate drones, like the VPs at Anonymous Large Tech Company reading straight off of a script. No connection with the audience. But Stu was just easily able to connect with all these people. He got up in a tweed jacket and jeans and stood up in front of about 50,000 people and FIRST Robotics kids and just organically goes, ‘MY PEOPLE!’ with his arms outstretched like he was the Moses of nerds…and the crowd just went nuts,” said Peterson.

 Stu was also the only dean of admissions who actually spoke to the admitted class at the preview weekend. It seemed to me that these other deans felt that their jobs were now over and they could retreat back behind their Ivy League desks, kick their feet up and take a nice nap. Stu, however, stays involved with students even after their applications have been through his office. He writes blogs addressed to students who weren’t admitted, reassuring them that even if they were disappointed, they were great applicants. He told MIT’s newspaper, The Tech, his advice to students on how to work through self-doubt when they are struggling with their classes. “I think you could see it in the fact that he is a freshman advisor. In every case that I can think of where he became aware that one of our student bloggers was having a hard time, he cared a lot,” said Peterson. You can really tell that Stu gets the most excited now when he talks about students because his eyebrows, which jumped and giggled when he talked about his friendships on crew and in New House, nearly hit the ceiling.

According to Peterson, Stu and Matt McGann, the director of admissions, both see their work as highly important professions morally, as opposed to just another job they could do. One thing that they have changed about MIT admission to reflect that is reducing the names they buy from the College Board. All universities go to the College Board with ranges of test scores, then they buy a certain number of names within that range so that they can send materials to encourage them to apply. Most colleges want to attract the widest range possible to keep their acceptance rates low to appear more selective and desirable. “We have actually pulled back on the amount of names we buy because we don’t want to attract students that we don’t think have a chance of being accepted and doing well here. Stu has essentially said we could easily drive up our applications by 50% and look like great recruiters, but we don’t want to create more misery in the world by rejecting more people just to keep our metrics good,” said Peterson, who later compared Stu to a moral North Star.

Stu’s strong sense of morality won’t stop him from absolutely demolishing a poor, helpless pizza. Peterson recalls:

“Stu is not a big guy. It was in regular action, we were in committee, and it must have been 10:30 at night. We were still in the office making decisions so we decided to order dinner. It was right when Domino’s was launching their 5-5-5 pizza plan. So we each ordered a pizza. I am used to killing a pizza on my own… but Stu crushed his. I remember him just leaning backward, rubbing his belly, groaning, ‘why did I eat all that…? Why…? What a terrible decision…oh… oh, no… that was so bad.’ And he had this very endearing dad regret. You could really see at once the MIT athlete just push through work from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm crush a pizza combined with that dad-like, ‘that was a bad idea… that was a horrible decision.’”

In how he approaches being a boss, Stu relies on his experiences at GM and as a crew coach, doing his best to bring out the best in the people around him. “He does it better than anyone I’ve ever worked with. He’s really respected no only by people in our office, but among deans of admission and peers and counterparts. It’s not uncommon to go to one of these admissions conferences and to hear people say ‘well if I could work for any admission dean I would work for Stu.’ I think he really inspires through a variety of interpersonal characteristics that bring out this kind of loyalty. He really gets the most out of people he works with. I don’t know how he does it… I don’t have this skillset but he’s really, really great at it,” said Peterson. Stu describes his talents a little differently, saying, “I realize its not what I do that really matters, it’s the people around me and the best that I can do is assemble the good people around me. Things are gonna work better when that happens. Maybe I’m not doing nothing but generally my attitude is not to try to do things that others can do better, but to help and motivate them to do the best that they can.”

IV. Looking forward

Though each year is a different challenge, Stu and the admissions crew aren’t looking to make any drastic strategic changes. “I think my vision for the future face of MIT students is right about what it is now. I feel like things are pretty good,” Stu said. 

The scarier thought is dealing with his daughters’ approaching college process. On his admissions blog bio, he wrote that they were prospective members of the class of 2022 and 2024. “Now that its getting close enough I’ve gotta take that off,” he said when I asked him if that was still in the cards. “When they were little it was funny, but my oldest is in high school. The odds that they will make it into MIT are low just because they are for everyone, you know? I love them and they’re wonderful kids, but who knows. And I don’t want them to have that kind of pressure. The problem is MIT is the only school they ever know of.” His voice breaks a little when he tells me, “I used to tell them growing up all the things that we look for: work hard and this and that. Finally, years ago, my youngest said to me, “Dad stop you’re putting too much pressure on me! I’m just a kid. I hope you’ll still love me even if I’m not perfect. And that took me, so I stopped. Now I don’t talk to them about college at all, so I don’t push them on activities or anything.” However, even admissions deans have protective dad instincts that kick in. “Sometimes I worry, because I’m like what are you guys doing? You’re just sitting around playing video games. I think, “oh, you could be doing something! You could read a book or something!” But I’m sure I wasted a lot of time as a kid too. It is a hard balance because you do wanna encourage them and push them a little bit.”

As for doing college tours elsewhere, Stu will be going incognito. “I’ll have to hide myself behind some sunglasses so it’s gonna be a little weird.” I suggest he disguise himself as a certain news comedy show host.

Speaking of Colbert, 2 years later and he still has not responded to the admissions video. I take that to mean he admits defeat to the Moses of Nerds.
