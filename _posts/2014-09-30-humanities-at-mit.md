![A well-worn copy of _The Riverside Chaucer_ in the office of MIT, Arthur Bahr, the only medieval literature scholar at the institute. ](/https://ifeverythinghadaword.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/dsc_0341.jpg)

When Noam Chomsky created the first philosophy class at MIT in the 1950s, he knew there would be questions. But he was not expecting to have a young engineer walk into his office and ask him if taking this class would help him talk to girls from Radcliffe, like the Harvard boys who could casually spout Kant at their leisure.

MIT humanities classes have certainly evolved since then, growing from a few classes to an entire world renowned School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (SHASS). Deborah Fitzgerald, the school’s dean, [recently wrote an op-ed](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/04/30/mit-humanities-are-just-important-stem/ZOArg1PgEFy2wm4ptue56I/story.html) for the Boston Globe, claiming that “at MIT — a bastion of STEM education — we view the humanities, arts, and social sciences as essential, both for educating great engineers and scientists, and for sustaining our capacity for innovation.” MIT even requires a significant proportion of its undergraduate curriculum to be in SHASS—eight classes in four years. 

Still SHASS faculty at MIT face significant and often unseen challenges as academics in a primarily technical institution. For example, most SHASS departments lack graduate programs. “Without graduate students, no one pursues your line of research,” said Chomsky, who developed MIT’s linguistics program, which is one of the few [graduate programs in SHASS](http://shass.mit.edu/graduate). According to medieval literature professor Arthur Bahr, many of the faculty are the only scholars in their field at MIT, making it difficult to produce the quality and quantity of scholarship that faculty at other schools can from teaching their research to graduate students. 

Faculty also perceive a significant difference in students’ approach to humanities classes. “It’s demoralizing knowing that many of the students in my entry-level medieval literature course will expect the class to be their easy A,” said Bahr. The issue, according to Helen Lee, a professor in creative writing, is that while MIT students are naturally imaginative and used to high expectations, very few come to MIT to major in the humanities. She recalled a student who wrote a piece about SHASS classes being a “necessary evil” and even read it aloud in her class. “Sometimes I wish I had an entire classroom full of people asking what else they could read or if I would read their next story,” said Lee, comparing it to her teaching experience in MFA and prison writing programs.

But Lee believes this extends beyond MIT academia to more systemic cultural issues. When she applied to be a housemaster for one of MIT’s graduate dorms, she was told that the students did not want someone from the humanities—they wanted someone who worked in their disciplines. “That was quite a blow,” she said. “Here I was talking about all the humanities programs I wanted to do for the students to expand their education at MIT, and it seemed like the message was, ‘We don’t want to be expanded.’”

For Lee, the solution will need to be top-down. “If professors in science and engineering all valued and understood us, that could be integrated into our conversation about what we’re doing here—that being educated means being exposed to different disciplines and being pushed. Our requirements say that, but our voice doesn’t. We could pay faculty differently, have more programming, make it a more visible part of everyone’s life. Otherwise there’s a real blindness in the non-SHASS faculty. On institute committees, I often feel like something or someone they just don’t know how to process.” 

But SHASS faculty are quick to point out that teaching humanities subjects at MIT can have its advantages. Bahr says that the smaller department size actually gives professors the freedom to teach and research whatever they want, like his new class in Old English last year. He and Lee both believe there is definite kinship within SHASS. “Humanities is a lonely field—we don’t have labs or collaborate in quite the same way as scientists,” said Bahr. “But I could not have written my books without my colleagues. That’s an amazing thing to be able to say as a humanist.”

All of the faculty agree that there is a small cohort of students who truly do love the humanities. For theater professor Janet Sonenberg, teaching a sample class helped convince her to come to MIT. “They didn’t know a particular concept, so I began instead with a really advanced concept. You could do it decently with technique, but you really needed imagination to excel at it. It was like casting a fly when you fish and the trout rise—well, there were a bunch of big trout in that class, and it was so exciting. I didn’t even care that they didn’t know the original concept, because what they did know was coming from themselves and their worldview.”

Still these students are few in number: while all 4500 MIT undergraduates are required to take humanities classes, [only 116 of last year’s graduates majored in SHASS fields, half of which were in economics](http://web.mit.edu/registrar/stats/yrpts/index.html), a fairly quantitative field at MIT. 

Despite the institutional challenges, the professors argue strongly that MIT’s focus on research and innovation means humanities belong at MIT. “What all of us have in common is teaching a mode of engagement about critical inquiry and re-inquiry,” said Bahr. “We get an initial impression of a data set or a poem, form hypotheses, test them, and use counterarguments to refine them. That’s applicable to engaging with the world, not just texts or robots. That’s why the way I teach fits with MIT students—it reinforces a model they already know and believe in.”

Sonenberg echoes this sentiment: “There’s a genuine understanding of the practice of art, like theater, as laboratory work, and this is something my engineering colleagues understand. Artists and engineers? We get each other.”

Or, as many of the faculty suggest, they _should_ get each other. For MIT to live up to its rankings as a world-class institution, it will have to take a much harder look at whether the "MIT Humanities Experience" is all it really should be.
