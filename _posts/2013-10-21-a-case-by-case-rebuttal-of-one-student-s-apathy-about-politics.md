## A case-by-case rebuttal of one student’s apathy about politics

MIT students don’t really care about politics.  

This fact should be obvious enough to anyone who pays attention – at MIT, there are none of the big campus rallies, protests, or gatherings traditionally associated with student activism.  In fact, it’s likely that any single MIT student will only see his or her entire class assembled three times: Orientation Week, Ring Premiere, and graduation.

I had always been aware of this apathy, but a blog post by a classmate explaining why he does not care about a myriad of political issues compelled me to respond.  Note that none of these arguments are personal.  I seek only to puncture the cushion of privilege that these viewpoints are written from, and convince the author that yes, he should care about politics.

Some representative quotes from the blog post in question:

## **Affirmative action**
> “I just need to work hard enough to get myself into places in spite of affirmative action (I am Asian American, and affirmative action helps other groups at my group’s expense.”

The author evidently believes that the purpose of affirmative action is to allow low-achieving minorities to achieve positions they don’t deserve, at the expense of more qualified applicants.

As with most things, perspective is useful.  So here’s an analogy: consider a very tall mountain that two people must climb.  Person A is given the very latest in climbing equipment and has received extensive training in climbing and mountaineering.  Person B is given a rusty icepick and a fraying rope, and has never seen a mountain before.

After several days of climbing, Person A reaches the summit several hours before Person B.  But considering the tremendous advantages that he had, can we really say that Person A is a better climber?

Context is important.  A major factor colleges take into consideration when making admissions decisions is potential.  Being born into a more privileged position does not mean that you are more deserving of a spot, or even that you will be more capable when presented with more resources.  

The amount of privilege in the author’s claim is frankly astounding.  He states earlier that both of his parents have stable jobs and earn enough that their biggest concern about the economic downturn is their stock options taking a dip.  In short, he has benefited from being born into a middle-class family (or higher), for which money has never been a real issue.  He has never had to go hungry because a paycheck arrived late.  

I encourage the author to read [this blog post](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/diversity-or-merit) by Chris Peterson, an admissions counselor at MIT.

## **Philosophical waxings on government**

> “I believe the government exists only to provide a minimum standard of living.  As long as my safety, well-being, and ability to pursue a better life are guaranteed, I am okay with the status quo.”

I agree mostly with the first sentence here.  My view of morality is more-or-less Rawlsian – I believe we should try to create the society each of us would want if we didn’t know in advance who we’d be.  And I believe that the government has an obligation to guarantee a minimum level of opportunity for everyone.  

And yet the author directly contradicts this in the next sentence.  What the author evidently means here is that the government exists only to provide a minimum standard of living…for him.  As long as his safety, well-being, and ability to pursue a better life is guaranteed, then everything’s perfectly fine – who cares about the plebes anyway?

I’m not sure how to categorize this naïve and rather ludicrous opinion.  Pseudo-libertarian?  Selfish?  I would encourage the author to step out of his bubble into the real world – poverty in America isn’t just some abstract statistic.  It’s a very real thing that affects real people every day.  If the author believes that the current government already guarantees a minimum level of safety, well-being, and opportunity for everyone, he should probably open his eyes.

## **Gay marriage**

> “I am not interested because it does not affect any of my friends or family.”

The claim that the author does not have any LGBT friends or relatives is almost certainly false.  [According to the Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/2007/05/22/fourinten-americans-have-close-friends-or-relatives-who-are-gay/), 41% of Americans say a close friend or member of their family is openly gay.  Considering that the author is currently in a highly diverse environment, attending a university that brings together people from all across the world, the odds that he knows someone who is LGBT rise significantly.  Either the author is very selectively choosing friends or he is just being willfully ignorant.

But let’s pretend for a moment that the author really doesn’t know any LGBT people.  This still does not constitute an argument for apathy.  Imagine someone in the 1960s arguing that “because I don’t know any black people, I don’t care about civil rights for all.”  This argument, when applied to gay marriage, is equally ludicrous.

As noted earlier, the author believes in the minimum amount of government possible.  Except when it pertains to issues of civil liberties, apparently.
I encourage the author to read [this compelling op-ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/opinion/sunday/26bruni.html) by Frank Bruni, a gay columnist at the New York Times.
 
In conclusion, I highly encourage the author to reconsider his apathy towards politics – not only because I believe he is dead wrong about many issues, but also because this sort of willful ignorance is harmful for society as a whole.
