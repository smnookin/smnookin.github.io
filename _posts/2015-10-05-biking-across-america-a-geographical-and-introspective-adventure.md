_Three months and 3000 miles more seasoned, Spokes team members reflect on their journey and on adjusting to “normal” life._

A crowd of family members and supporters eagerly received a group of beaming bikers on the iconic Golden Gate Bridge on what passersby would have considered a typical, cloudy San Francisco August day. This group, however, had just completed a bike ride spanning the United States’ width.

This past summer, a team of seven Harvard and MIT students (collectively called Spokes 2015) embarked on a mission to teach science and engineering subjects to kids across the nation. The group implemented a creative curriculum that enabled students to take more ownership of their learning, in an effort to modify the traditional classroom setting and reach students in a variety of communities.

Throughout the course of three month long trip, the Spokes team strictly alternated between two daily routines: the biking days and the teaching days.

The biking days (the team averaged 70-80 miles per day) taught the Spokes members both expected and less foreseeable lessons.  Considering the endurance she built throughout the journey, Harvard junior Francesca Childs said, “I don't think I fully prepared myself for the biking aspect. I just never fully thought through how intense it would be at times”. Despite the physically demanding nature of the trip, the bikers traveled solo rather than together, allowing lots of time to think.

A remarkable insight the group realized was the surprising altruism from strangers throughout the trip. MIT sophomore Jorge Tronsoco said, “I find it amazing that in so many places, people let us sleep in their houses--some even cooked dinner for us. And they had no reason to do this! Sometimes people wouldn’t even be in the house but would offer their houses to strangers”. This trust in complete strangers was prevalent throughout the trip. The website warmshowers.com, a network of cyclists who offered to host other bikers throughout the route, further exemplified this ability for a shared interest to form a community, even amongst people who had never met.

Additional perks of traveling through foreign towns and into strangers’ houses included hearing a plethora of stories from people of all backgrounds. Jorge was particularly fond of an avid hiker who shared his experiences walking through the PCT, and of a pastor who coded as a hobby.

Teaching days involved teaching Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) subjects in a hands on way, where students could learn from doing rather than just hearing someone talk. There were three workshops, ranging from computer science to robotics to model rocket building, and each of which began at 10am and either took up half a day or an entire day.

When thinking back to a memorable time with a student, Jorge described a home schooled, shy student from Farmington, Connecticut. The diligence with which the young boy worked clearly indicated his interest in electronics. However, he did not quite understand the principles behind the robot he had made—Jorge proceeded to draw a circuit diagram, with the boy quietly observing. After copying the diagram, the student proudly showed his dad that evening. Jorge was humbled by the boy’s admiration for him, and by the feeling of being able to serve as a mentor for someone.

Francesca was particularly impacted by the similarities between herself and some of her students over the course of the summer. “One that comes to mind is when a high school junior asked to stay after class to ask us about applying to college. It was fun to talk to her and hear how her fears were so similar to mine,” she said.

While the team overall achieved the objectives they set out to accomplish, there were some aspects they would like future groups to adjust. Jorge said, “For my workshop, the instructions were too clear, so there wasn’t a lot of room for creativity.” He mentioned that he thought of ideas but never implemented them, because he knew that one day for the workshop would no longer have been enough. If he were to participate again, he would choose an easier workshop to give more room for design and creativity. Francesca shared similar sentiments, saying “I felt rushed in general”. 

Additional flaws arose with respect to the student profile. Spokes students ranged from 1st graders all the way up to seniors in high school—a broad range with respect to age only, however. The students were a result of self-identification as those who already enjoyed STEM. Jorge saw this self-selection as an advantage, however, since he thought that interested students would “get more out of the workshops” due to their existing enthusiasm. Additionally, as the student ages increased, the overall profile dramatically shifted from gender balanced to male dominated. The Spokes team had not thought of or addressed the issue of gender disparities in STEM, perhaps because at schools like MIT, this gap is almost nonexistent.

Having now been back in the college grind for a few weeks, the Spokes team members have gone through varying levels of struggle transitioning back into the more usual college student lifestyle. Francesca found it hard adjusting to life without a set schedule and purpose. She said, “I definitely miss the day-to-day routine of Spokes in some ways.” Jorge’s thoughts contrasted, as he said, “we followed a very stable routine every single day,” similar to the often repetitive routine of college life.

Even in everyday life nowadays, the team members reflect on their experience, and on how the adventure shaped them and their thoughts. Many of them joined for the sense of adventure biking across America provided. Jorge said, “I got a job offer for the summer, but this was too unique to pass up.” He also did not have preconceived notions going into the trip, saying “I never expect anything when I go into anything, because I feel like when you expect something, it sets you up for feeling sad if things don’t live up to what you wanted”. However, he does think about the potential impact of the team’s efforts—both idealistic and realistic. “Maybe the workshops aren’t having that big of an impact… This could just be a day workshop and the kids go back to the rest of their lives,” Jorge said.

Francesca said she joined because she wanted to do something crazy to see how she would react. As a smile crept up on her face, she said, “I never saw myself doing any crazy trip like this, but I guess its possible to be completely outside your comfort zone and adapt. I definitely have more confidence, and everyday challenges at school seem miniscule compared to some of the difficulties the team surmounted this summer.” Harvard senior and another Spokes team member Tola Omilana said, “The question ‘So, what now?’ seems especially pertinent going into senior year. To be perfectly honest, I don’t really have THE answer right now. But c’est la vie,” (‘That’s life,’ in French).

Overwhelmingly, the Spokes team realized that throughout the process, the process of teaching and learning is very much a two-way street, as they often learned from the students and families they intended to teach along the way. The team sometimes asked students that if they could be one thing when they grew up, what it would be. The best answer in Francesca’s opinion was “I would be someone who knew what he wanted to be.”
