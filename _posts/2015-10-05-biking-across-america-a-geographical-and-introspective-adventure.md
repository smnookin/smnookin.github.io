What do a 3,000 mile bike ride and a redefined classroom have in common? For a team of seven Harvard and MIT students, the overlap formed the basis of a journey they dedicated the past three months of their lives to.

Collectively called Spokes 2015, this group embarked on a mission to teach students across the nation science and engineering subjects, with a twist. Armed with the mission “Inspiring students to learn what they love,” Spokes team members were united by their desire to rethink Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education.

The group implemented a creative curriculum that they hoped would enable students to take more ownership of their learning, in an effort to modify the traditional classroom setting and reach students in a variety of communities. Stated on their website, the team is “dedicated to revealing the exploratory, self-directed, and boundless nature of learning to students across the US.” Their mission stems from the simple idea that learning often occurs through “semi-random” pursuits into fields that genuinely interest people, and primarily outside of a classroom.

Spokes members structured their teaching sessions around what they called “learning festivals.” These workshops entailed teaching hands-on, project-based classes based on the team’s own interests within STEM. A dozen schools, libraries, and camps across America hosted the team over the course of the summer, directly reaching out to students in the local communities to gather interest. 

Throughout the course of three month long trip, the Spokes team strictly alternated between two daily routines: the teaching days and the biking days.

Teaching days involved three workshops, ranging from computer science to robotics to model rocket building, and each of which emphasized the creative process throughout.

Focusing on mechanical engineering, the model rocket workshop aimed to point out to students how “different design decisions can drastically change the outcome of their product,” allowing freedom for exploration for the students building the rockets. In the electrical engineering workshop, “students [were] encouraged to think about personalizing their robots in the future,” further allowing this flexibility.

One of MIT sophomore Jorge Tronsoco’s most memorable encounters was with a shy, home schooled student from Farmington, Connecticut. The diligence with which the young boy worked clearly indicated his interest in electronics. However, he did not quite understand the principles behind the robot he had made—Jorge proceeded to draw a circuit diagram, with the boy quietly observing. After copying the diagram, the student proudly showed his dad that evening. Jorge was humbled by the boy’s admiration for him, and by the feeling of being able to serve as a mentor for someone.

Harvard junior Francesca was particularly impacted by the similarities between herself and some of her students over the course of the summer. “One that comes to mind is when a high school junior asked to stay after class to ask us about applying to college. It was fun to talk to her and hear how her fears were so similar to mine,” she said.

High school senior Aaron Smith was one of the students who participated in Spokes’ learning festivals in Hazard, Kentucky. For Aaron, the prestige of Harvard and MIT students is what attracted him to participate in Spokes. Aaron also appreciated the smaller age gap between himself and the instructors. He said, “I felt more comfortable knowing there wasn't so much of an age difference between me and those I learned from. Knowing that I could possibly be in a position that they were in in just a few years is very cool.”

Aaron’s typical school schedule is regimented down to the minute, and packed with science and engineering courses. Comparing school to his experience in the festivals, Aaron said, “Spokes was very hands on and interesting, which was a welcomed change.” While he already had an interest in STEM, he said, “Spokes helped to show that coding isn't as complicated as I had originally thought and allowed me an easy, interactive way to start working on coding more.” He mentioned his goal of incorporating more hands on learning after his Spokes experience. A determined student, Aaron intends to triple major in Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, a decision that Spokes helped ground.

The biking days (the team averaged 70-80 miles per day) taught the Spokes members both expected and less foreseeable lessons. Despite the physically demanding nature of the trip, the bikers traveled solo rather than together, allowing lots of time to think.

The group was surprised by the altruism from strangers throughout the trip. Jorge said, “I find it amazing that in so many places, people let us sleep in their houses--some even cooked dinner for us. And they had no reason to do this! Sometimes people wouldn’t even be in the house but would offer their houses to strangers”. This trust in complete strangers was prevalent throughout the trip. The website warmshowers.com, a network of cyclists who offered to host other bikers throughout the route, further exemplified this ability for a shared interest to form a community, even amongst people who had never met.

Additional perks of traveling through foreign towns and into strangers’ houses included hearing a plethora of stories from people of all backgrounds. Jorge was particularly fond of an avid hiker who shared his experiences walking through the PCT, and of a pastor who coded as a hobby.

While the team overall achieved the objectives they set out to accomplish, there were some aspects they would like future groups to adjust. Jorge said, “For my workshop, the instructions were too clear.” If he were to participate again, he would choose an easier workshop to give more room for design and creativity. Francesca shared similar sentiments, saying “I felt rushed in general”. Additionally, Spokes students ranged from 1st graders all the way up to seniors in high school—a broad range with respect to age only, however. The students were a result of self-identification as those who already enjoyed STEM. Jorge saw this self-selection as an advantage, however, since he thought that interested students would “get more out of the workshops” due to their existing enthusiasm.

Nowadays, the team members reflect on their experience, and on how the journey shaped them and their thoughts. Many of them joined for the sense of adventure biking across America provided. Francesca said, “I never saw myself doing any crazy trip like this, but I guess its possible to be completely outside your comfort zone and adapt. I definitely have more confidence, and everyday challenges at school seem miniscule compared to some of the difficulties the team surmounted this summer.” Another Harvard Spokes team member Tola Omilana said, “The question ‘So, what now?’ seems especially pertinent going into senior year. To be perfectly honest, I don’t really have THE answer right now. But c’est la vie,” (‘That’s life,’ in French).

Overwhelmingly, the Spokes team realized that throughout the process, the process of teaching and learning is very much a two-way street, as they often learned from the students and families they intended to teach along the way. The team sometimes asked students that if they could be one thing when they grew up, what it would be. The best answer in Francesca’s opinion was “I would be someone who knew what he wanted to be.”
