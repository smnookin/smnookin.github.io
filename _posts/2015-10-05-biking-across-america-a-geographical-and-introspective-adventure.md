Biking across the country is a strenuous undertaking but not so rare as to merit special attention all on its own. Similarly, there are plenty of groups trying to make the four subjects collectively known as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) more enticing for young students. But a cross-country bike trip that teaches an innovative STEM curriculum along the way? Now that’s something new. 

That’s exactly what a team of seven students from Harvard and M.I.T., known as Spokes 2015, did this past summer.

“I think everyone should have the opportunity to learn by doing,” MIT sophomore Drew Bent said, capturing the gist of the team’s motivations for pursuing such an ambitious journey.

Collectively called Spokes 2015, this group embarked on a mission to teach students across the nation science and engineering subjects, with a twist. The group implemented a creative, workshop-centric, curriculum that they hoped would enable students to take more ownership of their learning, in an effort to modify the traditional classroom setting and reach students in a variety of communities. The team is dedicated to “revealing the exploratory and boundless nature of learning to students across the US,” Bent said. Their mission stems from the simple idea that learning often occurs through semi-random pursuits such as self-directed projects into fields that genuinely interest people, and primarily outside of a classroom.

Spokes members structured their teaching sessions around what they called “learning festivals.” These workshops entailed teaching hands-on, project-based classes. A dozen schools, libraries, and camps across America hosted the team over the course of the summer, directly reaching out to students in the local communities to gather interest. 

Throughout the course of three month long trip, the Spokes team strictly alternated between two daily routines: the teaching days and the biking days.

Teaching days involved three workshops, ranging from computer science to robotics to model rocket building, and each of which emphasized the creative process throughout.

Focusing on mechanical engineering, the model rocket workshop aimed to point out to students how “different design decisions can drastically change the outcome of their product,” allowing freedom for exploration for the students building the rockets. In the electrical engineering workshop, “students [were] encouraged to think about personalizing their robots in the future,” further allowing this flexibility.

One of MIT sophomore Jorge Tronsoco’s most memorable encounters was with a shy, home schooled student from Farmington, Connecticut. Although diligent, the boy did not quite understand the principles behind the robot he had made— Tronsoco proceeded to draw a circuit diagram, with the boy quietly observing. After copying the diagram, the student proudly showed his dad that evening. “I was humbled by the boy’s admiration, and by the feeling of being able to serve as a mentor for someone,” Tronsoco said.

Harvard junior Francesca Childs was impacted by the similarities between herself and some of her students over the course of the summer. “A high school junior asked to stay after class to ask us about applying to college,” she said. “It was fun to talk to her and hear how her fears were so similar to mine,” particularly with respect to finding a suitable match, Childs said.

High school senior Aaron Smith was one of the students who participated in Spokes’ learning festivals in Hazard, Kentucky. For Smith, the prestige of Harvard and MIT students is what attracted him to participate in Spokes. Smith also appreciated the smaller age gap between himself and the instructors. He said, “I felt more comfortable knowing there wasn't so much of an age difference between me and those I learned from. Knowing that I could possibly be in a position that they were in in just a few years is very cool.”

Smith shared how his typical school schedule is regimented down to the minute, and packed with science and engineering courses. Comparing school to his experience in the festivals, Smith said, “Spokes was very hands on and interesting, which was a welcomed change.” While he already had an interest in STEM, he said, “Spokes helped to show that coding isn't as complicated as I had originally thought and allowed me an easy, interactive way to start working on coding more.” He mentioned his goal of incorporating more hands on learning after his Spokes experience. A determined student, Smith intends to triple major in Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, a decision that Spokes helped ground.

The biking days (the team averaged 70-80 miles per day) taught the Spokes members both expected and less foreseeable lessons, Tronsoco said. Despite the physically demanding nature of the trip, the bikers traveled solo rather than together, allowing lots of time to think.

The group was surprised by the altruism from strangers throughout the trip. Tronsoco said, “I find it amazing that in so many places, people let us sleep in their houses--some even cooked dinner for us. And they had no reason to do this! Sometimes people wouldn’t even be in the house but would offer their houses to strangers”. This trust in complete strangers was prevalent throughout the trip. Churches and campsite often welcomed the team with open arms with a place to sleep at night, while local museums helped integrate the group into the local communities. The website warmshowers.com, a network of cyclists who offered to host other bikers throughout the route, further exemplified this ability for a shared interest to form a community, even amongst people who had never met.

Additional perks of traveling through foreign towns and into strangers’ houses included hearing a plethora of stories from people of all backgrounds. Tronsoco was particularly fond of an avid hiker who shared his experiences walking through the PCT, and of a pastor who coded as a hobby.

While the team overall achieved the objectives they set out to accomplish, there were some aspects they would like future groups to adjust. Tronsoco said, “For my workshop, the instructions were too clear.” If he were to participate again, he would choose an easier workshop to give more room for design and creativity. Childs shared similar sentiments, saying “I felt rushed in general”. Additionally, Spokes students ranged from 1st graders all the way up to seniors in high school—a broad range with respect to age only, however. The students were a result of self-identification as those who already enjoyed STEM. Tronsoco saw this self-selection as an advantage, however, since he thought that interested students would “get more out of the workshops” due to their existing enthusiasm.

Nowadays, the team members reflect on their experience, and on how the journey shaped them and their thoughts. Many of them joined for the sense of adventure biking across America provided. Childs said, “I never saw myself doing any crazy trip like this, but I guess its possible to be completely outside your comfort zone and adapt. I definitely have more confidence, and everyday challenges at school seem miniscule compared to some of the difficulties the team surmounted this summer.” Tola Omilana, a Spokes team member from Harvard, said, “The question ‘So, what now?’ seems especially pertinent going into senior year. To be perfectly honest, I don’t really have THE answer right now. But c’est la vie.” 

Overwhelmingly, the Spokes team realized that throughout the process, the process of teaching and learning is very much a two-way street, as they often learned from the students and families they intended to teach along the way. The team sometimes asked students that if they could be one thing when they grew up, what it would be. The best answer in Childs’s opinion was “I would be someone who knew what he wanted to be.”
