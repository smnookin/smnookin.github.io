## Catholic Synod October 2014

![Francis_crowd_Mass.jpg](/_posts/Francis_crowd_Mass.jpg)    Things have changed in the Catholic Church since 2013 when Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected as the Catholic Church’s new leader, Pope Francis. Recently the Pope convened a synod, basically a meeting of selected Catholic Bishops, to focus on the church’s stance and doctrine on the [future of the family]( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/opinion/what-is-a-catholic-family.html), most notably the issue of same sex couples.
	
Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, the last leader of the Catholic Church, was well known for being an enforcer of long-standing Catholic doctrine and a very conservative and traditional catholic leader. The transition from his to Pope Francis’s reign has been shocking to some conservatives, but very refreshing to many other Catholics. 
	
With the world changing as quickly as it is, many people, some Catholics included, believed that the Church was falling out of step with the rest of the world. Pope Francis, with his unprecedented willingness to discuss tough current issues, has been able to change that view. Last week’s synod was a perfect example of the change the new Pope is causing in the slow-to-transition Catholic Church. What’s so shocking about this meeting of Bishops isn’t that it is occurring, but that it is happening right under the public’s eye, with open discussions, published briefings, and an unprecedented overtness. 
	
It’s relieving to realize that even a part of society notorious for resisting change is taking a step in the right direction and adapting to the times. The first report released by the synod described a “[greater spirit of openness and a more welcoming attitude toward gays and lesbians.](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2014/10/17/synod-bishops-take-steps-toward-transparency-tolerance/9eoiQH13CjsJPGEXGNpeJI/story.html)” After this report was met with outcry from some Catholics across the world, as well as from conservative bishops and cardinals, a second English translation was released which took a more restrained tone. Still, the fact that this discussion is happening in the open, with church officials debating in the public’s eye, is a big change for the usually private Church.

This shift in attitude towards same-sex couples, as well as the increasing spirit of openness, is drawing people in. Some waning Catholics, who felt unwelcome during Benedict’s reign, are getting drawn back into the Church because of the transition Pope Francis has started. His views on acceptance and mercy are appealing to most people; instead of the strict fire and brimstone doctrine that Benedict and several Pope’s before him preached, Pope Francis’s talk of helping one another and being humble in your faith are more appealing to everyday sorts of people. Younger Catholics who may have been falling out of step with their religion because of its opposition to adaptation have since reclaimed the title of Catholic.
	
Some people say the Catholic Church is outdated, and in the past few years has had more than enough bad press. This synod and new policy of inclusion and transparency is changing public opinion. Pope Francis has been instrumental in this change of public opinion, and although he has his critics, both inside the church and outside, he has been met with great amounts of support. It will be interesting to see what else will come from the ongoing synod, and how Pope Francis will continue to reshape the Catholic Church and its teachings.
