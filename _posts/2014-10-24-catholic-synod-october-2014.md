![Francis_crowd_Mass.jpg](/_posts/Francis_crowd_Mass.jpg)    Things have changed in the Catholic Church since 2013, when Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected as the Catholic Church’s new leader, Pope Francis. Recently, the Pope convened a meeting of a group of Catholic Bishops, called a synod, to focus on the church’s stance and doctrine on the [future of the family]( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/opinion/what-is-a-catholic-family.html), most notably the issue of same sex couples. 
	
The church's previous leader, Benedict XVI, who resigned as Pope in 2013, was well known for being a conservative enforcer of long-standing Catholic doctrine. The transition from his tenure to that of to Pope Francis has been shocking to some conservatives, but very refreshing to many other Catholics. 
	
With the world changing as quickly as it is, many people, some Catholics included, had come to believe that the Church was falling out of step with the rest of the world. Pope Francis, with his unprecedented willingness to discuss tough current issues, has worked to change that view. The October synod was a perfect example of the change the new Pope is causing in the slow-to-transition Catholic Church. Adding to the impact of these changes is the fact that they're taking place in public, with open discussions, published briefings, and an unprecedented overtness. 
	
It’s relieving to realize that even a part of society notorious for resisting change is taking a step in the right direction and adapting to the times. The first report released by the synod described a “[greater spirit of openness and a more welcoming attitude toward gays and lesbians.](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2014/10/17/synod-bishops-take-steps-toward-transparency-tolerance/9eoiQH13CjsJPGEXGNpeJI/story.html)” After this report was met with an outcry from some Catholics across the world, as well as from conservative bishops and cardinals, a second English translation was released, which took a more restrained tone. Still, the fact that this discussion is happening in the open, with church officials debating in the public eye, is a big change for the usually private Church.

In the long run, this can only benefit the Catholic Church, as the shift in attitude towards same-sex couples, as well as the increasing spirit of openness, draws in people who might previously have felt alienated. Instead of the strict fire and brimstone doctrine that Benedict and several Popes before him preached, Pope Francis’s is much more accepting, and talks regularly of helping others and being humble in your faith. This accepting approach is more likely to be appealing to younger Catholics who may have been falling out of step with their religion because of its opposition to adaptation.
    
Some people say the Catholic Church is outdated, and in the past few years the Church has had more than enough bad press. This synod and new policy of inclusion and transparency is changing public opinion. Pope Francis has been instrumental in this change of public opinion, and although he has his critics, both inside and outside the Church, he has been met with great amounts of support. It will be interesting to see what else will come from the ongoing synod, and how Pope Francis will continue to reshape the Catholic Church and its teachings.
