**Janet Malcom**'s highly regarded <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/21W/fa13/21W.737/courseMaterial/topics/topic9/readings/Journalist_and_the_Murderer_-_Pt._1/Journalist_and_the_Murderer_-_Pt._1.pdf">investigation into the ethics of journalism</a> famously begins: "Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible." This is a test change to see if I get an error message.
