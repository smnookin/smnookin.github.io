This highly regarded <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/21W/fa13/21W.737/courseMaterial/topics/topic9/readings/Journalist_and_the_Murderer_-_Pt._1/Journalist_and_the_Murderer_-_Pt._1.pdf">investigation into the ethics of journalism</a> drew both high praise and deep condemnation. The book famously begins with a powerful indictment of its subject: "Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible."
