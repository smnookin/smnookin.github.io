There are over 600,000 homeless people in the US on any given night, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). A lot of whom are families living in rural areas, unnoticed by society. Most of them live a nomadic lifestyle, moving from one small town to another, but never quite settling. This was once the former life of former MSNBC gossip column writer, Jeanette Walls. In her memoire, The Glass Castle, Jeanette recalls her family doing the “skedaddle” whenever her parents were bored of their current city or town—or more likely, whenever it became clear that her nonconformist father, Rex Walls, would finally get caught. 

The Glass Castle is written in deceptively simple prose, mimicking the thought-process of a child, and highlighting Walls’ incredible skill as a writer. The words simply transfix the reader and the chapters, unnumbered and untitled, are short enough to trick the reader into believing the book is shorter than its already short 288 pages. It is divided into 4 unequal sections: “The Woman on the Street”, “The Desert”, “Welch”, and “New York City,” each of which describe periods where she lived wholly different lifestyles. 

She describes her mother, who was probably bipolar, and her father, an alcohol addict, with the criticism of an outsider, but she also takes care to balance the bad with the good. The first description of her father portrays him as an raging alcoholic who “drank whenever the family had money which wasn’t often, ”and, when sober, as a physics-loving dreamer who loved his family, dreamt of building a solar-powered “Glass Castle” for them and taught them to face their fears. 

The description of her mother is much more mundane in comparison. She describes days when her mother would paint all day, rather than cook lunch or dinner and other days when she would refuse, crying, to wake up and work even though she had a teaching degree and her husband never had a stable job. Confronted by Walls, she’d exclaimed “It’s not my fault if you’re hungry!” Her jaw-droppingly selfish mother had even hid a large chocolate bar from the starving family in order to savor it on her own. “I’m a sugar addict!” she’d defended herself.


The family constantly moved around from Arizona, her mother’s hometown, to California, Battle Mountain and Las Vegas until finally making their way to Welch, West Virginia—her father’s dreaded impoverished hometown where the majority of dwellers receive some form of government aid. The Walls family, in fact, also qualified for government aid, but her mother staunchly refused to accept any, saying that she did not want the children believing that they were charity cases. That being said, the family was starving. Her father, on the other hand, disappeared upon arrival, going into bars and staying away from home for days in a futile attempt to drown out the memories of his miserable childhood.

Combine her irresponsible parents with the bullying and loneliness Walls and her siblings faced in school, and the abandoned, falling-apart houses they lived in, and you have a recipe for self-assured and fearless child—or a permanently scarred one.  

It is simply amazing that the siblings, or at least [all but one](http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Entertainment/story?id=552776&page=1), avoided the latter fate, and it is even more astonishing that Walls is where she is now. Understandably, she had kept her roots a secret from the public for nearly two decades and it wasn’t until she saw her widowed mother, Rose Walls, rummaging through garbage in the New York streets, homeless, that she came clean. At the time she was living in a luxurious apartment in Park Street with her first husband.

Her mother chose this life, Walls said in an [interview with Oprah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naAy_juIOQk). Her father had already died of liver failure, and she claimed that her mother preferred the lonely, harsh life in the streets to the padded, jewel-encrusted life in Park Street. Maybe so, but she clearly wanted out, since after Walls moved to the countryside—a 280-acre farm outside Culpeper, Virginia—with her second husband, her mother moved in with her. Why only then? It’s likely that Walls must have doubled her efforts to convince her mother to move in after she was in the spotlight—so as to not ruin her reputation. Were her previous efforts to help her widowed mother in vain? That’s for the reader to decide.

On the other hand, Walls shows incredible compassion towards her parents—at least she does so[outside of the memoire](http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Entertainment/story?id=552776&page=1). After all, her parents shaped her to be the driven, goal-oriented and successful woman she is today. Her parents must have definitely seen that in her, because her frustrated mother had once told her, “Jeanette, you’re so focused it’s scary,” an insult that Walls took as a compliment. She and her siblings spent a year saving up for the day when they would leave their destructive parents behind and start a new life in the city of dreams, New York city. The day before she left, her mother was distraught and Walls tried to comfort her. Her mother shaking her head said, “I’m not upset because I’ll miss you. I’m upset because you get to go to New York and I’m stuck here. It’s not fair.” 

Walls definitely paints a harsh portrait of her parents, something she may have not intended to do given that she originally wrote the memoire as a [homage to her parents](http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Entertainment/story?id=552776&page=1). More importantly, her memoire makes it clear that every troubled person comes with a tragic history. In the words of her mother, who had her wise moments, “No child is born a delinquent. They only become that way if no one loved them when they were kids.” She’d been referring to her husband at the time, who was likely sexually abused by his mother—who was in turn orphaned an abused by her relatives. 

Similarly, her mother’s irresponsibility likely stems from the strict lifestyle of her own mother, and coupled with her bipolar illness, she had a very self-absorbed personality. The kids, then, were completely abandoned when the father focused his attention towards drinking away his nightmares. What goes around comes around. Right? After all, it would have been too easy for the Walls children to follow the family trend and become bitter alcoholics, but they managed to use their teamwork and resourcefulness to make it out. And that, in itself, is an amazing feat.

Walls’ longing for the “Glass Castle” is strong in the memoir and certainly a major symbol in the book. What is symbolizes, however, Walls said could be either hope for the future or simply one of her father’s drunken promises. “It is whatever you make of it”, [she said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW0XVno-0gM). Whichever is true, it is clear that the Glass Castle dream died in Welch, when the family quit the “skedaddle” and the hole Walls and her brother dug for Glass Castle foundation was slowly filled with garbage. The biggest tragedy in the story may be that Rex Walls never lived to see the Glass Castle dream flower—in the success of his daughter. 

As for other critisms… Of course I can point out that her memory in the hospital when she was four-years old is too vivid to be true, and how farfetched it is that a zoo cheetah would harmlessly lick her hand, but as Walls said in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIqPov5UbRE) “people are just interested in a good story.” And whether or not every astonishing detail of the memoire is true, this well-written book does an exceptional job of telling a good story.
