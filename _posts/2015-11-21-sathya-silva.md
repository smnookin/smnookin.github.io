A characteristic scene greeting those entering Silva’s apartment in MIT’s dorm Maseeh Hall is an almost perpetually open door, propped in place by a tiny rubber doorstop shaped like a paper airplane. Silva, a fifth-year PhD student in MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, devotes as much energy to her role as a source of support and comfort for those around her as she does to her role as an aviation aficionado and field expert.

Among the experiences that both have shaped Sathya Silva and now comprise her contribution to the world are a dream-turned-reality of pioneering work in the aviation industry, her role as a mentor to students, and a personal loss that has enabled her to spread positivity.

Silva, a 29-year-old Sri Lankan-American woman with straight, dark brown hair, and mocha skin, has a beaming smile plastered on her face that contrasts the serious nature of her work. She has developed her interest in all things flying throughout her life and is now wrapping up projects that have been adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration and directly feed into improving the safety of future airplane system designs, work that impacts everyone who will travel via flight in the future.

Over the past five years, Silva has been studying the “divergence between crew mental model and actual system state.” In other words, she has come up with a theory explaining why pilots’ perceptions of reality differ from what is actually going on. Her work involves looking at dozens of accidents to identify trends that can help explain what goes into human decision-making.

Often times this discrepancy she studies is attributed to “pilot error.” “I don’t like to use that term, since it’s often not the pilot’s fault,” Silva said. According to Silva, a lot of the times people actually change what they see to fit their meld of what they expect. “Usually the faults occur when humans try to normalize something abnormal,” she said.

Silva’s work, which she hopes will address many pitfalls that currently plague the aviation industry, is a sort of culmination of a lifetime fascination with the world above our heads. 

An early defining moment for Silva was in 3rd grade, where the class theme was space. Her teacher was really good at encouraging the students and flourishing their passion. Since then, Silva has wanted to be an astronaut. “I haven’t really let go of that dream, and so everything I’ve done has been getting me closer to that dream,” Silva said. Sathya was driven to act on her space passion, particularly when college came around, by joining the Flying Club.

“I remember that feeling the first time we took off. I felt at home. I think I was grinning the whole time,” Silva said. That first flight was a huge turning point for Silva. Flying was something that she hadn’t expected to be a passion. “That one day shaped the rest of my life, and I can still say that,” Silva said.

After that initial experience, Silva continued her training. “I got totally addicted,” she said. She became a flight instructor at only 20 years of age, an uncommon feat considering the many hours of training required for certification. “Instructing was the perfect mix, because I love a challenge and living on the edge. I work really well in high-stress environments, so teaching students to land in situations where we were so close to death was the perfect opportunity for me,” Silva said.

Through an internship at a technical aviation firm and a Masters project on pilot safety, Silva quickly developed with a passion for improving aviation safety. “I wanted to make a difference in the world. That’s what I came back to school for,” Silva said. Silva worked on a stint in NASA’s Johnson Space Center post graduation, after which she decided to come to MIT.

Beyond her scientific prowess however, lies another side of Sathya that defines her impact perhaps equally: her human one. Silva’s Co-Graduate Resident Tutor (GRT) Jason Haas, said, “I like how passionate she is. She worked at NASA, but it’s just another thing to her.”

“At MIT, being a GRT was by far the best decision I ever made,” Silva said. Before GRTing, Silva found it hard to find meaningful friendships, and it was hard for her to find a home. “Turns out that all the meaningful relationships were in this building,” Silva said.

Silva hopes that that she motivates (‘inspire’ is a very strong word, she said) and is not overbearing. Helping others has given her energy, while teaching her about herself and growing internally. Silva realized that it’s a big transition to being empathetic but not taking on people’s burdens. “Maintaining a balance between some kind of authority but still being able to form real connections with the undergrads involved being open about communication. It’s really enlightening,” Silva said with a soft sigh of appreciation in her eyes.

When Halloween rolled around this year, Sathya went all out. He said that GRTs don’t get a ton of discretionary money, but that Sathya still doggedly pursued making the Halloween spread, a detail many would ignore. Regarding an upcoming floor study break, Haas said that Silva didn’t have to take all the supplies out for tomorrow’s study break, but there they were, perched upon her kitchen island counter top. “She has a very pragmatic but very joyful approach. What more can you ask, especially from an MIT grad student?” Haas said as he half-laughed.

If Silva passed by, beaming smile and energy radiating from her presence, one would never be able to guess the formative hardships hidden behind her outpouring of warmth and positivity.

One of her best friends from college, Wesley, committed suicide in April. They had just reconnected two weeks before he died. They were both “floating on air” after the day they met, and Silva remembers thinking, “I finally got my friend back after all those years!”

Silva walked through her thoughts after the incident. “I had never really felt those things before; going through all of those stages of grief. I’m a more controlling person, so this taught me how to accept certain things and let them go. I had to remake those memories so I wouldn’t be scared of them anymore. And I had to understand his state of mind, so getting more information was really important for me. It was good for me to experience those feelings, because now I can empathize with people better because of it.”

Silva said that the experience has made her see the good in a lot of things. She was able to get close to his family—they told her so much more than what she had known about him and what she had done for him, which she had no idea about. “There was one other time when he had considered suicide, and I was the reason he didn’t do it. You never know who’s listening and you never know what they’re going through,” Silva said.

After the incident, Silva thinks there’s no reason to be cranky or put her ego on a pedestal. “It’s been really important for me to smile, even at random people in the hallway. I’ve really been into blowing the whole Boston stereotype out of the water. I’ll just take the weird looks.”

Haas really respects how she has been able to keep her chin up despite all of the tough times she has been through. “She was around for students when she could be around, but she was also really good at saying ‘I need to lean back,’” Haas said

As far as her PhD journey goes, Silva said, “I think the biggest thing I’ve learned is that I need to take care of myself, and I’m the only one who’s going to be doing that. Regardless of how others will take it.” In a world where each is out for his/her own, Silva has learned how to “deflect attacks, how to detach from and turn around a situation with anyone who is being really antagonistic. The people you work with are much more important than the work you’re doing,” she said, for the second time in the conversation.

Pausing a moment to reflect on the stories she had just shared, Silva said, “It’s definitely a process. It’s really hard to keep sight of things when in the middle of it. Knowing that something will come out of it. It will get better. It will be over. You kind of just have to roll with the punches.”

So what does this all amount to for Silva? “Changing the world is two-fold to me,” Silva said.

She hopes that her work in graduate school will be “a little ripple in the pond” that will help bring awareness to analyzing new accidents and coming up with new trends. As for her future career, she will be joining the National Transportation Safety Board in 2016, where “everything that we do is for the betterment of aviation safety.” Silva said that there is “not one single person who is there just because; everyone has passion.”

On a more personal level, Silva believes that “I think changing one person’s life is enough. There could be so much that comes out of it—whether just for them or something they do for humanity. I didn’t know what I was saying gave [Wesley] 10 years, yet his parents thanked me for that.” Haas seems to feel the impact of Silva’s presence, saying, “clearly she’s giving and thoughtful, and strong and resilient in other ways too. As someone who studies what she studies, she pursues good times, and I appreciate that about her.”

A goal Silva is actively pursuing now is running the 2016 Boston Marathon, an idea she shared with a tinge of anxiety, wide-eyed and a bit skeptical. Running has always been cathartic for her. “I had started running in college with Wesley, and I couldn’t stand it. It didn’t even occur to me that I could do it, but Wesley was always the one who ran behind me and would yell at me to pick up my feet when we would run together,” Silva said.

With respect to her training process, Silva said it has been opening up her horizons quite a bit in terms of what she’s capable of. “It’s helped me extract myself from my perceptions of and glass ceilings for myself,” she said. Haas mentioned how as a result of finding ways to productively honor Wesley, Silva has even forged a beautiful relationship with the Housemaster’s dog Mickey.

“I sort of see Sathya as someone who is really good at taking lemons and making lemonade,” Haas said.
