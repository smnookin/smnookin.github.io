On October 23rd,ten students from Fossil Free Wellesley met with representatives from the school’s Board of Trustees, Vice President for Finance and Administration Ben Hammond, Chief Investment Officer Deborah Kuenster, and President Kim Bottomly to ask the board to divest from publicly traded fossil fuel companies within the next two years.

This year, the group has been staging die-ins, a type of protest where students simulated, petitioning and spreading awareness for their cause around campus.

Divestment can pressure corporations or governments to make certain social changes. Recent divestment campaigns have targeted sweatshop labor, use of landmines, and tobacco advertising, according to [Eric Hendey at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University](http://www.iop.harvard.edu/does-divestment-work). 

The Fossil Free movement is a nationwide effort led by [Bill McKibben](http://www.billmckibben.com/), the author dozen books on climate change and the founder of the grassroots [350.org](http://350.org/) campaign, to encourage college students to pressure their colleges to divest from oil stocks. The movement began last spring at Wellesley College.

Fossil Fuel companies are contributing to climate change, impacting communities, air quality, and water quality. According to Fossil Fuel Wellesley, Fossil fuel use is expected to cause 100 million deaths in 18 years, effecting primarily people of color and lower socioeconomic standing. 

“It’s more than an environmental issue, and divestment sends a clear symbolic message to fossil fuel companies about consumers’ moral values,” Fossil Free Wellesley argues on their website.

“Climate change and fossil fuel extraction is a defining issue of this generation,” says Wellesley freshman Meredith Wade, who recently got involved in the campaign. “Because Wellesley is fairly well known and respected, it is considered a leader in the higher education community, so I think we have a lot of influence.” 

But Wellesley’s administration is hesitant.  If the college divests, there will be a decrease in returns from the endowment. According to Debora Kuenstner, the chief investment officer, forty percent of Wellesley’s revenues come from the endowment, and considering the complex nature of their investments, divestment is a risk Wellesley is unwilling to take.
Last month, she spoke at a college government meeting, skeptical of divestment’s effectiveness. 

Wellesley’s investments are managed by three privately hired managers. “One of [the managers] has a portfolio that only owns about twenty stocks,” Kuenster said. “If you say to them, of those twenty stocks, we want these eighteen and not these two, that’s a big difference in what that portfolio looks like, and those managers will basically decline to take our business,” she said at the meeting. This would lead to an annual 1.6 million dollar loss in the endowment, according to a recent [Wellesley News article](http://thewellesleynews.com/2013/10/30/fossil-free-wellesley-meets-with-board-of-trustees-chief-investment-officer-says-divestment-could-cost-the-college-1-6-million/). 

“Based on my experience doing socially responsible investment, I do not think that investment is effective,” Kuenstner said at the college government meeting. 

Moving forward, Fossil Free Wellesley plans to continue researching the impact of divestment on the endowment, alternative investment options and whether or not widespread divestment would impact on climate change.

Some students argue that the campaign doesn’t take the college’s true needs into account. 

“I have a problem with Fossil Free Wellesley because they seem more concerned about their ideals of saving the environment then how it will affect the college. It’s detrimental to the college, and they are placing ideals above what the college needs,” said sophomore Julia Foster.

Other students say that the campaign is not properly presenting facts and information.  

“The way they [Fossil Free Wellesley] present the facts is ‘this is why the environment is deteriorating’ which is not something people are arguing. They aren't acknowledging the fact that the college is losing money. They present theoretical statistics and statistics of smaller schools [who have divested] which don’t apply to Wellesley, and act like those numbers would be proof when we have direct information from the Chief Financial Officer” said sophomore Emily Williams.

If Wellesley divests, it wouldn’t be the first time. In the 1980s, there was a student run campaign calling upon the school’s president and board of trustees to divest from apartheid in South Africa. But students against today’s divestment campaign argue that divesting from companies that operated in South Africa was a completely different situation. 
“When colleges around the country decided to divest from companies that operated in South Africa, their goal was to pressure to dismantle, and it is fair to assume that the deeper goal was to stop racism in South Africa. However, dismantling the fossil fuel is not the first step toward environmental protection. While South Africa was physically able to operate without Apartheid, our world is not physically able to operate without fossil fuels” said Williams.

The moral motivations behind today’s campaign are honorable. Everyone knows that climate change exists and that we are facing environmental consequences, and who doesn’t want to fight that? But the way Fossil Free Wellesley presents its case makes it seem as if those opposing the Fossil Free campaign are denying the effects that fossil fuel companies have on the environment, which isn’t the case. Plus, the solutions to climate change are more complex than simply divesting. Personally, I’m not sure that Fossil Free Wellesley has considered the full issue at hand and has not thoroughly thought through the environmental and financial implications of divestment. Until there are feasible, stronger, and more reliable sources of energy, I do not think that divestment will stop fossil fuel companies. These accompanies are also hard at work researching alternative energy sources, so a movement like this would make more sense once there are affordable and reliable energy sources available.
