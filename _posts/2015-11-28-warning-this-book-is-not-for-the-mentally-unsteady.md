The first time I read Robert Whitaker’s “The Anatomy of an Epidemic,” I took a lighter to one of the chapters. I left a scorch mark on the page as publisher Broadway Books’ 2010 book was describing a man who was addicted to Klonopin, and Whitaker’s meticulous description of how this man’s life was ruined by this drug drove me into a craze. As an anxious college student, I was on Klonopin at the time, and was stricken for the first time with the idea that I might never stop taking this medication that can poison someone’s life so easily.

So it continued. This book was extremely informative, but triggering as hell. It was not for the faint of mind.
I doubt that Whitaker intended to frighten every teenage girl into tears. In the book, he looks to determine why psychiatric disability numbers are rising, while more and more people are being prescribed antidepressents, and more is being spent on antidepressant and antipsychotic research each year. With all the effort put into solving this
“epidemic,” why are the numbers increasing?

Whitaker asks, “Could our drug-based paradigm of care, in some unforeseen way, be fueling this modern-day plague?”
“The [Government Accountability Office], in its June 2008 report, concluded that one in every sixteen young adults in the United States is now ‘seriously mentally ill.’”

I would be considered “seriously mentally ill,” which is a scary phenomenon to think about. I have trauma-induced (and MIT-induced) depression. It goes away during calm times in my life, such as when I do not have really hard classes and am not struggling. When I was first matched with a counselor for help with feeling terrible mentally  at school, she wanted to prescribe me antidepressants, without telling me what was wrong with me. Was I depressed? Did I need those medications? I refused, so she prescribed me something for short-term anxiety and help with sleeping. Little did I know, one of those was more than highly addictive, and the other was actually an antidepressant.

Is it the pharmaceutical companies?

I went to the pharmacy the other day to get my Aripiprazole, or Abilify. According to Google, Abilify treats schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. It was a tier II medication, which means that instead of costing me the normal $10 copay, it costs double, at $20, each month. The cost without insurance? Over $700 for sixty tiny pills. And people say this drug is magic, like they need it in their lives to survive. I take a smaller dose than prescribed so it lasts longer.

How does this actually relate to the book?

“In 2007, we spent $25 billion on antidepressants and antipsychotics,” Whitaker says, more than the gross domestic product of a small country.

However, with the introduction of these new medications and the amount spent on them each other, “the number of disabled mentally ill in the United States has skyrocketed. This does not include people like me who can work and take classes full-time and function normally on a day-to-day basis. “850 adults and 250 children every day… receive a disability check from the federal government.”

I may not need Abilify to survive, but if I don’t take it each morning I will get one killer withdrawal headache. So I spend my $20 on it a month, watching the money drain away sadly. 

Whitaker looks at four cases in the beginning. One is a schizophrenic who believed that psychiatrists do not care about patients in the long-term. Another is someone with bipolar disorder who was misdiagnosed with depression. A third – Dorea, “an extremely smart and capable person, barely escaped [long-term hospitalization.” Whitaker says, “If you expand the boundaries of mental illness, which is clearly what has happened in this country during the past twenty-five years, and you treat the people so diagnosed with psychiatric medications, do you run the risk of turning an angst-ridden teenager into a lifelong mental patient?”

He continues to introduce cases. Are these the extremes? He does use the word extreme in the book 29 times. Whitaker found these cases through a group at McLean Psychiatric Hospital in Belmont, MA. Does that automatically make these the extreme cases, since it is one of the last mental hospitals in the area for short and long-term patient stays and experimental studies?

Was the purpose of this book to give Whitaker’s perspective on why medication is over-prescribed and an epidemic with an anatomy? He used an awfully large amount of scientific data and statistics if that was the goal. Was it to scare society into thinking that taking medications is wrong? Did he want to traumatize teenagers into thinking there is something wrong with them for taking medication, like the book traumatized me the first time I read this book?

Whitaker showed proof that these medications cause long-term harm for patients, yet my doctors that I trust prescribe it to me daily, and have been for two years now.  “This is a story of neurotransmitter pathways that have been transformed by the medication. After several weeks, their feedback loops are partially disabled… The drugs do not normally brain chemistry, but disturb it… The MRI studies showed that antipsychotics worsen the very symptoms they are supposed to treat, and that this worsening begins to occur during the first three years that the patients are on the drugs.”
Well that is scary.

However, Whitaker does offer potential solutions, or “blueprints for reform” for the epidemic he describes with detail. Whitaker points out that a conventional medication withdrawal program arisen from research would be very helpful to society to avoid cases like those he had acknowledged in the book.

“As a society, we put our trust in the medical profession to develop the best possible clinical care for diseases and ailments of all types. We expect that the profession will be honest with us as it goes about this task. And yet, as we look for ways to stem the epidemic of disabling mental illness that has erupted in this country, we cannot trust psychiatry, as a profession, to fulfill that responsibility.”

Great, now I can sleep at night knowing that I cannot trust my doctors.
