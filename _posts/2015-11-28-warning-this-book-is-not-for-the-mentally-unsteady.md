The first time I read Robert Whitaker’s “The Anatomy of an Epidemic,” I took a lighter to one of the chapters. I left a scorch mark on the page as Whitaker described a man who was addicted to Klonopin, and Whitaker’s meticulous description of how this man’s life was ruined by this drug drove me into a craze. I was stricken for the first time with the idea that I might never stop taking certain medications that could poison someone’s life so easily and make an even more anxious person out of an anxious person.

The book is extremely informative, but it is triggering as hell. It is not for the faint of mind.

It is not likely that Whitaker intended to frighten every teenage girl reading his book. In the book, he looks to determine why psychiatric disability numbers are rising, while more and more people are being prescribed antidepressents, and more is being spent on antidepressant and antipsychotic research each year. With all the effort put into solving this “epidemic,” why are the numbers of people with disabilities increasing?

Whitaker asks, “Could our drug-based paradigm of care, in some unforeseen way, be fueling this modern-day plague?”

“The [Government Accountability Office], in its June 2008 report, concluded that one in every sixteen young adults in the United States is now ‘seriously mentally ill.’”

Whitaker asks - are pharmaceutical companies driving this rise in mentally ill diagnoses? He brings this up in a meaningful and thought-provoking discussion, highlighting key points and giving many examples and statistics supporting his assertions.

He supports the pharmaceutical company question with the following fact: “In 2007, we spent $25 billion on antidepressants and antipsychotics,” more than the gross domestic product of a small country.

However, with the introduction of these new medications and the amount spent on them each other, “the number of disabled mentally ill in the United States has skyrocketed." Whitaker provides support, “850 adults and 250 children every day… receive a disability check from the federal government.” This provokes thought of the word disability and what it means to identify as disabled.

Whitaker looks at four cases in the beginning. One is a schizophrenic who believed that psychiatrists do not care about patients in the long-term. Another is someone with bipolar disorder who was misdiagnosed with depression. A third – Dorea, “an extremely smart and capable person, barely escaped [long-term hospitalization].” Whitaker says, “If you expand the boundaries of mental illness, which is clearly what has happened in this country during the past twenty-five years, and you treat the people so diagnosed with psychiatric medications, do you run the risk of turning an angst-ridden teenager into a lifelong mental patient?”

He continues to introduce cases. Are these the extremes? He does use the word extreme in the book 29 times. Whitaker found these cases through a group at McLean Psychiatric Hospital in Belmont, MA. Does that automatically make these the extreme cases, since it is one of the last mental hospitals in the area for short and long-term patient stays and experimental studies?

Was the purpose of this book to give Whitaker’s perspective on why medication is over-prescribed and an epidemic with an anatomy? He used an awfully large amount of scientific data and statistics if that was the goal. Was it to scare society into thinking that taking medications is wrong? Did he want to traumatize teenagers into thinking there is something wrong with them for taking medication?

Whitaker showed proof that these medications cause long-term harm for patients, yet many doctors that patients trust prescribe those medications daily, and have been doing so for decades.  “This is a story of neurotransmitter pathways that have been transformed by the medication. After several weeks, their feedback loops are partially disabled… The drugs do not normally brain chemistry, but disturb it… The MRI studies showed that antipsychotics worsen the very symptoms they are supposed to treat, and that this worsening begins to occur during the first three years that the patients are on the drugs.”

Well that is scary.

However, Whitaker does offer potential solutions, or “blueprints for reform,” for the epidemic he describes with detail. Whitaker points out that a conventional medication withdrawal program arisen from research would be very helpful to society to avoid cases like those he had acknowledged in the book.

“As a society, we put our trust in the medical profession to develop the best possible clinical care for diseases and ailments of all types. We expect that the profession will be honest with us as it goes about this task. And yet, as we look for ways to stem the epidemic of disabling mental illness that has erupted in this country, we cannot trust psychiatry, as a profession, to fulfill that responsibility.”

Great, now I can sleep at night knowing that I cannot trust my doctors. Thanks, Whitaker.
