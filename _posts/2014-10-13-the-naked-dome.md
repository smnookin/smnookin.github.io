It's always exciting when a new hack appears at MIT. As people begin to notice the hack's arrival some morning, news will travel backwards into the dormitories and living groups, and soon people will trek well beyond their normal commute to get a good view.

Outside of the Institute, hacking has come to be associated with malicious computer access. However, MIT's IHTFP Hack Gallery helpfully provides that:

> The word hack at MIT usually refers to a clever, benign, and "ethical" prank or practical joke, which is both challenging for the perpetrators and amusing to the MIT community (and sometimes even the rest of the world!)

Or, to put it another way, we turn to the script of MIT's own home-spun musical, *Hack, Punt, Tool*. From the mouth of the narrator, the Story Jack:

> Hackers are anonymous technological pranksters, engineers inspired to intervene with the everyday monotony. In order to perform bold feats, hackers often traverse MITâ€™s more untraveled passageways, carefully avoiding the diligent eye of the law, and often unearthing locations hidden from the average passer-by!

IF you know anything about culture or student life at MIT, you're likely at least faintly aware of hacking culture and the fruits of hacker labor through the years: in May of 1994, a campus police car replica appeaed, sirens and lights active, atop MIT's Great Dome. Over twenty years later, these acts are still cherished by the community as examples of MIT students' ingenuity.

They're also, then and now, illegal. Stories of how the campus police car appears on the Dome only reached the public ear many years later, well after the statute of limitations had run out. MIT's certainly not about to revoke any diplomas or press charges against people involved in that hack, but that doesn't mean that hackers are immune from legal troubles.

Quite the opposite, actually: there's a reason why the Great-Dome has been hack-free for a couple of years now. As MIT has grown increasingly weary of the legal and public relations ramifications of something going wrong among students on a roof, campus itself has been bolted down tighter in the name of security and safety. Since these points are difficult to argue against ("You're against the safety of students?"), it's been easier for MIT to shift towards higher scrutiny on hacking culture.

It wasn't always like this. MIT's Cambridge campus was completed in 1916, and its architect, William Welles Bosworth, ensured that the layout of buildings would force interdepartmental discussions at the intersections, as people went for their morning coffee. This attitude helped motivate MIT's longstanding open campus policy, where the public (even wihout MIT affilitation) is given permission to wander MIT's campus at pretty much any hour. This policy has usually manifest itself as congestion within main hallways during weekdays, but its spiritual result was that MIT's campus beyond its generally accessible areas were not locked down too tightly.

Such a setup allowed for a mutual sense of trust between the administration and hackers: the former would turn a blind eye to the latter's activities, as long as the latter did not do anything too stupid. For a surprisingly long time, this worked well: hacking became increasingly popular in the 70s, 80s and 90s, MIT received good local press praising their students, and students had a unique extra-cirricular.

By the arrival of the 2000s, however, MIT had a tangentially related problem. The pressure-cooker mentality had been around for a long time at MIT by then: an old motto, "Tech is Hell", dates to at least the 1920s, and in 1993 the domed roof on Building 7 had been hacked to look like a pressure cooker. Yet after a string of highly publicized student deaths on campus, MIT began to receive unwanted attention about its suicide rate, which appeared to be higher than at peer institutions. 

Legal action took place, and the last lawsuit was finally settled for an undisclosed amount in 2006, but the entire process had left the MIT administration with a few notes. First, it is deeply embarressing for MIT to be tangled up in any legal issues. Second, MIT is far less likely to be judged for watching *too* closely than it would be for not watching closely enough. Thus, excess liabilities, including students in dangerous and off-limits areas, should be curtailed.

Weary from legal battles, the MIT administration began handle hacking culture with increased scrutiny. The mid-2000s saw a marked rise in incidents between student and administrative relations, including the levying of felony charges against three hackers. The trio had entered MIT's off-limits Faculty Lounge by way of the elevator, and was not engaging in any malicious activity when caught, but MIT refused to participate in the trial. It finally took a mass of student, alumni, and faculty support before MIT begrudgingly stepped in to ask the court to dismiss the charges, but not before many thousands of dollars in legal fees had been absorbed arguing in court over what should have been an MIT-only matter.

MIT ended up favoring liability protection over student exploration. This isn't in and of itself unreasonable, but is indicative of a breakdown in trust between the administration and hacking groups. For decades, the policy of self-governance had served both sides well, but the newer concept of "plausible deniability" has shifted the balance away from hackers. Locks are in continual addition or upgrade across campus, penalties have been harsher, and the Facilities team even has marching orders to immediately remove any hacks seen on the Great Dome. The remaining hope is for a balance to be struck, where the MIT community can continue to enjoy hackers' work but MIT does not feel immediate legal pressure to stop them at all costs.

I hope that balance is found soon, or we could likely go a full four years without a dome hack, and everyone should get to see at least one during their time as a student.
