“If I had to sum up Dean Mthembu in two words, it would be: sass and steel,” says Adam Rodriguez, MIT Class of 2016. 

Ayida Mthembu is an Associate Dean at Student Support Services at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There, she helps students navigate course loads, social and personal issues, and the leaving and readmission process. True to her description, she has grown strong like steel through her many life experiences and often uses humor to connect with her students. Rodriguez characterizes the experience of working with her as: “No matter how nutty the situation you find yourself in may be, she finds ways to take the fear out of it using humor, without trivializing your experiences.” I recently had the chance to sit down with Dean Mthembu to discuss her life, MIT, and the struggle for justice.

As I wait for our appointment to begin, I stash a granola bar from the candy and snack bowl on the table next to me (as opposed to the table across the room, which has pamphlets about mental health… fewer calories, but not super tasty). She calls me into her office, which is rather bare, save for a few photos and books. Mthembu, an African American woman approaching her 69th year, closes the door and sits across from me. “What can I help you with?”

When I first met Mthembu, I was a little intimidated. I was on leave from MIT, in the preliminary stages of preparing my rather meticulous application for readmission to the Institute, and I wanted to establish contact with a dean in the office that would be reviewing my application. I was worried that, if I misspoke or conveyed anything but a shiny confidence, it might count against me in the committee’s evaluation. I brought bulleted lists of points I’d like to communicate, stammering and twisting anxiously through our first few appointments. However, as time went on, we established a more secure relationship. She told me stories from her time in school and tales of some MIT students’ hijinks- which I am not permitted to detail here- that she has had to mediate; through these more personal exchanges, I became more comfortable.

**Early Life**

Mthembu grew up in South Central Los Angeles in the late 1940s and early 1950s. She started kindergarten at the age of four. After donning a dunce cap for her inability to read, she decided to learn how outside of school. Within six months, she was reading ahead of the rest of the class. By the sixth grade, she was reading at a high school level.

Despite her obvious bright and tenacious nature, however, she faced racial discrimination from peers, teachers, and school faculty alike. Kids bullied her, pushed her, and tossed racial epithets her way. However, she “did understand, even at that age- people don’t realize how conscious kids of color are about what happens to them.”

Nevertheless, she did not let others’ bigotry deter her-- though it continued. By the time she reached high school, she was “off-the-charts in testing,” but the administration put her in the middle-track group of students. But she found ways to “take them on,” insisting on taking higher-level classes.

While she worked through high school in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement was getting “in full swing.” Conversations around race swelled and surged, emerging in all sorts of places-- from magazines to the grocery store; at home and even at the beauty shop. “In barber shops, they talk about sports and stuff, but in beauty shops, they talk about all kinds of things,” Mthembu said, and “beauty shops are places where women talk and girls get to hear them.” She learned in a beauty shop of the death of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till, murdered in Mississippi for speaking with a white woman in 1955. The black-owned magazine Jet, found on a table in the shop, ran a now-iconic centerfold, at the request of his mother, depicting Till’s dead and bloodied body, so “the world [could] see what they’ve done to [her] child.”

With the increasing awareness of police and social violence against black people and other people of color, it “was becoming more and more evident that the country was on a spiral towards confrontation around race.”

One night, when she was babysitting a preacher’s son, Mthembu fell asleep while studying after she put the child to bed. She woke later in the night to a living room full of people.They said, “Cheryl,” which was her name at the time, “we want you to meet the Reverend Martin Luther King.” In her sleepy haze, she didn’t process it, uttered a greeting, and- “blam!”- fell back to sleep, much to the amusement of the group.

She woke later, feeling a presence in the room. Lo and behold, Reverend King, then in his mid twenties, was seated in a chair across from her, just looking at her. Aware that she woke, he told her that she intrigued him, seemingly “unimpressed” at the chance of meeting him. By then, though King was in his mid-twenties, he was an esteemed figure in the Civil Rights Movement. They talked for a bit, getting to know each other. Before he left her to sleep, he said to her, “I hope you keep that attitude, of not just trying to please people.”

Despite continual racism in her high school experience, perpetuated by both students and counselors-- who pushed her to register for home ec-style classes, despite her high marks-- she graduated from Los Angeles High School and matriculated at California State University Los Angeles.

**Undergraduate Growth**

She began at Cal State in 1963, a political year in American History, with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an increasing awareness of the war in Vietnam, and a “growing towards... a black movement in California.” Nevertheless, Mthembu spent much of her first year enjoying the freedoms afforded to her in college. She had a boyfriend with whom she frequented cafes, listened to jazz, and played chess. She may have enjoyed these freedoms and nonpolitical extracurricular activities a bit too much, as she was placed on probation after this first year.

In the meantime, many people were “afraid that the black community was going to explode.” She notes that the increasing resentment of racial injustices was “similar to what’s happening in Ferguson.” This agitation came to a head in the summer of 1964, just before the start of her sophomore year. That August, she was working in a grocery store in the mostly-white Inglewood when she received a call: Watts, a primarily black neighborhood of Los Angeles, was rioting, or, “rebelling,” as Mthembu prefers to characterize it. Regardless of how you refer it, the uprising, which became a key turning point in the Civil Rights movement, prevented her from returning home after her shift, as the police had surrounded the area, not allowing anyone to enter or leave. She ended up finding a friend who could take her in and watched what’s now known as the Watts Rebellion on television with her friends in a swanky “white [owned] house in Beverly Hills.”

After a successful second year at Cal State, she transferred to San Francisco State College. On her first day, as she walked through the “odd, wonderful campus,” she stumbled into something unlike anything she had seen before: a hippie “love in.” Naturally, she called her mother, who told her that she shouldn’t fret about these cultural demonstrations that were strange to her; they probably won’t do it every day, after all, even if the hippie movement was blooming in San Francisco.

While at San Francisco State, she helped to form the country’s first Black Student Union, now a mainstay in many universities. As the year progressed, according to Mthembu, the climate of the campus grew “more radical” under the spectre of the war in Vietnam, the social taboo-breaking revelry of hippies, and the shadow of civil violence against black communities.

However, during her term, she began feeling ill and run-down. Some doctors suggested that it might be a mental problem and sent her to a psychiatrist; turns out, she had mononucleosis. She withdrew for some time, missing one of the largest U.S. campus actions in history, led in part by the union she helped to create.

On November 6th, 1968, after months of struggles and negotiations with the university, students at San Francisco State University- led by the Black Students Union and Third World Liberation Front members- [began a strike](http://www.library.sfsu.edu/about/collections/strike/chronology.html), which shut down the university until the following March. Those on strike produced a [list of fifteen demands](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/strike/bundles/187983), which included protections for black professors, the formation of a Black Studies department, and the granting of admission to all non-white applicants in the subsequent year.

San Francisco State was still on strike after Mthembu recovered from mono, so she elected to transfer, yet again, to University of California- Los Angeles. There, she helped to form a Black Student Union on campus and led classes such as “What the White Man Can Do,” which taught white students about how to be allies in the Civil Rights Struggle.

**Post-Undergrad**

After she graduated, Mthembu continued to work on anti-racist and community causes. She held positions in drug treatment programs, GED and other educational programs, and children’s homes, doing the “radical, helping-people thing,” as she put it.

Later on, in the early 1970s, she began working on a masters degree in screenwriting at the American Film Institute in New York City. While there, she produced her own personal radio show, “In Search of Perfection,” with the intent to “influence culture.” She preferred radio as a medium, as you “don’t have to worry about your hair” and could just “talk about concepts.” Though Mthembu graduated at the top of her class, she encountered trouble finding satisfying work in the industry. Back then, in the “pre-Spike [Lee]” era of film, “blaxploitation” movies were still in vogue and black writers faced mammoth unemployment rates. Mthembu characterizes Hollywood then as “full of shit.”

Later, in the late 1980s, she started another masters program in comparative culture from University of California Irvine. While studying there, she began to feel “tired of kinda churning” out work continuously and realized that she wanted to work with gifted kids, helping them to work for justice. She sent her resume to MIT’s Student Support Services- not knowing the details of the open position- at the suggestion of a friend and was rejected. As is her nature, she pushed forward, sending the committee a letter explaining why they should hire her, along with her much more extensive curriculum vitae. Impressed by her persistence, they invited her to interview, and she received an offer for the position of Assistant Dean at Student Support Services in 1989.

**Student Support Services**

Mthembu has since been promoted to Associate Dean. In her twenty-five-odd years at MIT, she has hosted movie series, workshops, and other events, many of them on the subjects of race, class, and gender. In the early 1990s, she returned to the medium of radio, collaborating with students- mostly students of color- to produce a WMBR radio show called “We Speak: The People’s Show” with the intent to get students and listeners in the community to think by discussing “issues of the day.” Later, she co-facilitated an educational film series in which they screened “marginal to left-wing- even some right-wing” films to illustrate and spark discussion about the history of race and culture, as well as their media portrayal. This series ran for nearly four years.

Given her “non-traditional college education,” she seems to hold fewer expectations for how one’s college career should pan out, which gives her perspective when helping students who come to her for assistance when taking leave from or returning to the Institute. In addition, her experience working for social justice particularly helps students from [culturally diverse](http://web.mit.edu/uaap/s3/about/am.html) backgrounds, as she has an idea of how structural and social climates can work to subjugate students from these backgrounds. One student I interviewed commented that he finds that he is able to “trust her advice” because he knows that she has “been through worse” and actually knows what it is like to be oppressed.

Dean Mthembu regularly goes above and beyond to help her students. For example, following a serious medical incident, Adam Rodriguez was having trouble paying some back fines to the Institute. Because of these overdue fines, MIT would not allow him to register, regardless of his low-income background, medical needs, and resulting inability to pay. After he talked with Mthembu, she took time to personally talk with a collections staff member and worked out an extension on his payment, allowing him to register for classes.

Her strategy includes building real relationships with students. It is fine to point to resources and write excuse notes; that is, technically, a student support dean’s job. However, she takes her work beyond her job description, if students are up to the task. She remarks, “when I talk to students, I talk in stories,” focusing not on “dry academics,” but on “a sense of who they are.” For many, this type of care goes a long way.

Another student whose name is withheld, “came from a smaller, more rural high school, where [she] had close relationships” with some of her teachers; at MIT, she “was overwhelmed by the disconnect” between students and professors. She felt lost and like “nobody cared if [she] failed” or succeeded, or about how she felt about herself or “the injustices in the world” and within the Institute itself. After struggling socially and academically, she turned to Student Support Services for help, where she met Mthembu, who was understanding of her pains and worries and whose stories gave her pieces of a framework through which to understand the world. “Really,” she says, “I just needed someone to talk to who wouldn’t try and prescribe me drugs” as a fix to her problems.

Now approaching 69 years of age, Dean Mthembu reflects that her age is “unbelievable” to her. Though she is close to her retirement, she continues to advocate for MIT students with an unwavering belief in our ability to use our gifts. With the allowance of MIT’s tendency to “let ideas happen,” she hopes to help us to help create a world without racism, sexism, and all the other ‘-isms’: a better, more liberated world for all.
