_“If I had to sum up Dean Mthembu in three words, it would be: sass and steel.” -Adam Rodriguez, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Class of 2016._    Ayida Mthembu is an Associate Dean at Student Support Services at MIT. At Student Support Services, she helps students navigate course loads, social and personal issues, and the leaving and readmission process. True to Rodriguez’s description, Mthembu's character has been tempered like steel by her many life experiences; she often uses bold humor to connect with her students. 

Rodriguez explains, “No matter how nutty the situation you find yourself in may be, she finds ways to take the fear out of it using humor, without trivializing your experiences.” I recently had the chance to sit down with Dean Mthembu to discuss her life, MIT, and her struggle for justice.

As I wait for our appointment to begin, I stash a granola bar from the candy and snack bowl on the table next to me. She calls me into her office, which is rather bare, save for a few photos and books. Mthembu, a 68-year-old African American woman with close-cropped grey hair and dangling gold earrings, closes the door and sits across from me. “What can I help you with?”

Short in stature and typically dressed in dark pants and decorative cardigans, Mthembu looks more like a grandmother than a radical activist. However, she has a whole lifetime of activism behind her, which she is eager to share with students. Though she now works with privileged students at an elite university, her past experiences in social justice heavily inform her current work.

**Early Life**

Mthembu grew up in South Central Los Angeles in the late 1940s and early 1950s. She started kindergarten at the age of four. After donning a dunce cap for her inability to read, she decided to learn how outside of school. Within six months, she was reading ahead of the rest of the class; by the sixth grade, she was reading at a high school level.

Despite her obvious bright and tenacious nature, however, she faced racial discrimination from peers, teachers, and school faculty alike. Kids bullied her, pushed her, and tossed racial epithets her way. However, she “did understand, even at that age--people don’t realize how conscious kids of color are about what happens to them.”

Nevertheless, she did not let others’ bigotry deter her--though it continued. By the time she reached high school, she was “off-the-charts in testing,” but her teachers put her in the middle-track group of students. Nevertheless,  she found ways to “take them on,” insisting on taking higher-level classes.

While she made her way through high school in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement was “in full swing.” Conversations around race swelled and surged, emerging in all sorts of places, from magazines to the grocery store, at home and even at the beauty shop. “In barber shops, they talk about sports and stuff, but in beauty shops, they talk about all kinds of things,” Mthembu says. “Beauty shops are places where women talk and girls get to hear them.” In 1955, when she was nine, she overheard talk of the murder of fourteen-year-old Chicago native Emmett Till, who was killed in Mississippi after speaking to a white woman. The black-owned magazine Jet, which she found on a table in the beauty shop, ran a now-iconic picture at the request of Till’s mother, depicting Till’s brutally battered and disfigured face so “the world [could] see what they’ve done to [her] child.”

With a growing awareness of police and social violence against black people and other people of color, it “was becoming more and more evident that the country was on a spiral towards confrontation around race.”

One night, Mthembu was babysitting a preacher’s son. After she put the child to bed, she fell asleep while studying. She woke later in the night to a living room full of people. They said, “Cheryl,” which was her name at the time, “we want you to meet the Reverend Martin Luther King.” In her sleepy haze, she didn’t process it, uttered a greeting, and--“blam!”--fell back to sleep, much to the amusement of the group.

She woke later, feeling a presence in the room. Lo and behold, Reverend King, then in his mid-twenties, was seated in a chair across from her, just looking at her. Aware that she had woken, he told her that she intrigued him for being seemingly “unimpressed” at the chance of meeting him. By then, though King was still in his mid-twenties, he was an esteemed figure in the Civil Rights Movement. They talked for a bit, getting to know each other. Before he left her to sleep, he said to her, “I hope you keep that attitude, of not just trying to please people.”

Mthembu faced continual racism in her high school experience, perpetuated by both students and counselors, who pushed her to register for home economics-style classes, despite her high marks. She graduated from Los Angeles High School and matriculated at California State University, Los Angeles.

**Undergraduate Growth**

Mthembu began at Cal State in 1963. It was a politically charged year in American history, with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an increasing awareness of the war in Vietnam, and a growing black empowerment movement in California. Mthembu spent much of her first year enjoying the freedoms afforded to her in college. She and her boyfriend spent a lot of time going to cafés, listening to jazz, and playing chess.

Even as she was spending time socializing, she says that there was a growing fear “that the black community was going to explode.” She notes that the increasing resentment of racial injustices was “similar to what’s happening in Ferguson.” This agitation came to a head in the summer of 1964, just before the start of her sophomore year. That August, she was working in a grocery store in the mostly-white Inglewood when she received a call: Watts, a primarily black neighborhood of Los Angeles, was rioting, or, “rebelling,” as Mthembu prefers to characterize it. Regardless of how you describe what was happening, the events in Watts became a key turning point in the Civil Rights Movement. They also prevented Mthembu from returning home after her shift, as the police had barricaded the area. She ended up staying with her white friend’s family in a swanky “white [owned] house in Beverly Hills.”

After a successful second year at Cal State, Mthembu transferred to San Francisco State College. On her first day, as she walked through the “odd, wonderful campus,” she stumbled across something unlike anything she had seen before: a hippie “love in.” Naturally, she called her mother, who told her that she shouldn’t fret about cultural demonstrations that were strange to her; they probably wouldn't happen every day, after all, even if the hippie movement was blooming in San Francisco.

While at San Francisco State, she helped to form the country’s first Black Student Union, now a mainstay in many universities. As the year progressed, according to Mthembu, the climate of the campus grew “more radical” under the specter of the war in Vietnam, the social taboo-breaking revelry of hippies, and the shadow of civil violence against black communities.

However, during her term, Mthembu began feeling ill and run-down. Some doctors suggested that it might be a mental problem and sent her to a psychiatrist; it turned out that she had mononucleosis. She withdrew from school for some time. This led her to miss one of the largest U.S. campus actions in history, led in part by the union she helped to create.

On November 6th, 1968, after months of struggles and negotiations with the university, students at San Francisco State University, led by the Black Student Union and Third World Liberation Front members, began a [strike](http://www.library.sfsu.edu/about/collections/strike/chronology.html), which shut down the university until the following March. Those on strike produced a [list of fifteen demands](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/strike/bundles/187983), which included protections for black professors, the formation of a Black Studies department, and the granting of admission to all non-white applicants in the subsequent year.

San Francisco State was still on strike after Mthembu recovered from mono, so she elected to transfer, yet again, to the University of California, Los Angeles. There, she helped form a Black Student Union on campus and led classes such as “What the White Man Can Do,” which taught white students how to be allies in the Civil Rights Struggle.

**Post-Undergrad**

After she graduated, Mthembu continued to work for anti-racist and community causes. She held positions in drug treatment programs, GED and other educational programs, and children’s homes, doing the “radical, helping-people thing,” as she puts it.

Later on, in the early 1970s, she began working on a master's degree in screenwriting at the American Film Institute in New York City. While there, she produced her own personal radio show, “In Search of Perfection,” with the intent to “influence culture.” She preferred radio as a medium, as you “don’t have to worry about your hair” and could just “talk about concepts.” Though Mthembu graduated at the top of her class, she encountered trouble finding satisfying work in the industry. Back then, in the “pre-Spike [Lee]” era of film, “blaxploitation” movies were still in vogue, and black writers faced mammoth unemployment rates. Mthembu characterizes Hollywood then as “full of shit.”

Later, in the late 1980s, she started another master's program in comparative culture from the University of California, Irvine. While studying there, she began to feel “tired of kinda churning” out work continuously, and realized that she wanted to work with gifted kids, helping them to work for justice. At the suggestion of a friend, she sent her resume to MIT’s Student Support Services, without knowing the details of their open position. She was rejected. As is her nature, she pushed forward, sending the committee a letter explaining why they should hire her, along with her much more extensive curriculum vitae. Impressed by her persistence, they invited her to interview, and she received an offer for the position of Assistant Dean at Student Support Services in 1989.

**Student Support Services**

Mthembu has since been promoted to Associate Dean. In her twenty-five-odd years at MIT, she has hosted movie series, workshops, and other events, many of them on the subjects of race, class, and gender. In the early 1990s, she returned to the medium of radio, collaborating with students- mostly students of color- to produce a WMBR radio show called “We Speak: The People’s Show.” Her intent was to get students and listeners in the community to think by discussing “issues of the day.” Later, she co-facilitated an educational film series that screened “marginal to left-wing--even some right-wing” films to illustrate and spark discussion about the history of race and culture, as well as their media portrayal. This series ran for nearly four years.

Her “non-traditional college education” seems to leave Mthembu with fewer expectations for how one’s college career should proceed. This gives her perspective when helping students who come to her for assistance when taking leave from, or returning to, the Institute. In addition, her experience working for social justice particularly helps students from [culturally diverse](http://web.mit.edu/uaap/s3/about/am.html) backgrounds, as she has an idea of how structural and social climates can work to subjugate these students. One student I interviewed commented that he is able to “trust her advice” because he knows that she has “been through worse,” and she actually knows what it is like to be oppressed.

Mthembu regularly goes above and beyond to help her students. For example, following a serious medical incident, Adam Rodriguez was having trouble paying back some fines to the Institute. Because of these overdue fines, MIT would not allow him to register, regardless of his low-income background and medical needs. After Rodriguez talked with her, Mthembu took time to personally talk with a collections staff member, and worked out an extension on his payment, allowing him to register for classes.

Her strategy includes building real relationships with students. It is fine to point to resources and write excuse notes; that is, technically, a student support dean’s job. However, she takes her work beyond her job description, if students are up to the task. She remarks, “when I talk to students, I talk in stories,” focusing not on “dry academics,” but on “a sense of who they are.” For many, this type of care goes a long way.

Another student, whose name is withheld, “came from a smaller, more rural high school, where [she] had close relationships” with some of her teachers; at MIT, she “was overwhelmed by the disconnect” between students and professors. She felt lost, and like “nobody cared if [she] failed” or succeeded, nor about how she felt about herself or “the injustices in the world” and within the Institute itself. After struggling socially and academically, the student turned to Student Support Services for help, where she met Mthembu, who was understanding of her pains and worries and whose stories gave her pieces of a framework through which to understand the world. “Really,” the student says, “I just needed someone to talk to who wouldn’t try and prescribe me drugs” as a fix to her problems.

Now approaching 69 years of age, Dean Mthembu says that her age is “unbelievable” to her. Though she is close to her retirement, she continues to advocate for MIT students with an unwavering belief in our ability to use our gifts. With the allowance of MIT’s tendency to “let ideas happen,” she hopes to help us create a world without racism, sexism, and all the other ‘-isms’: a more just world for all.
