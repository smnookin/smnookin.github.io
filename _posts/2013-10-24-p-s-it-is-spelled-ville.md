“There has never been another way to spell the Vil, it’s always been, V-i-l.” 
I politely smiled. For the past two days, I had been on a hunt to discover what the 
correct spelling of the “Vil/Ville” was. The word refers to a small retail section of 
Wellesley adjacent to the college. The Vil/Ville nickname is a fond term students use 
for the village where they often travel in packs to sniff out a bargain at the Gap or to visit the local watering hole, Starbucks. 

Somewhere between the day LSD became illegal and the 2001 Rolling Stone 
article, “The Highly-Charged Erotic Life of the Wellesley Girl,” the Vil dramatically 
picked up an additional ‘l’ and an E. The pronunciation remained the same. Most 
people are unaware there’s ever been a debate: When I asked residents and 
shopkeepers about the spelling conundrum, they had no idea what I was talking 
The Associate Editor of Wellesley Magazine, Lisa Scanlon ‘99, was the most 
helpful in explaining why the correct spelling is “Vil.” Back in the olden days, first year students were housed in the V-I-L. The upperclassmen resident assistants 
who lived in the V-I-L were known as V-I-L juniors. Wellesley College has thorough 
documentation of all of this. “Vil” is in Wellesley 
Magazine’s Official Handbook. 

The most recent alum I was able to interview was from the class of 1984. For 
security reasons, she did not wish to disclose her name or any information, but she 
did say that she wouldn’t think to spell V-I-L-L-E any other way. This information 
left me at a standstill. Without the input of older alumnae and the feverous, younger 
alumnae being outraged at the loss of L and E, I was not sure what my next step was. 
Fast forward a year and a half, I am still unable to define when the change 
occurred. A very important person whose name I will not mention for my own 
protection, let’s call her Mrs. V-I-L, demands that my job is not to pin point the 
historical date of the spelling change but to educate the ignorant. To avoid any fights breaking out, the college’s Public Affairs team avoids the word all together. Any 
sort of social media posting of the word can lead to seriously snarky comments (see 

picture above.) Interestingly enough, a recent post in my residence hall’s Google

group requests a ride for a quick trip to the “V-I-L.” I followed up with the email and 

did not see any foul play. The search continues with no end in sight.
