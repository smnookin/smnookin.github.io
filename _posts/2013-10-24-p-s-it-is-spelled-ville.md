“There has never been another way to spell the Vil, it’s always been, V-i-l.” I politely smiled. For the past two days, I had been on a hunt to discover what the correct spelling of the “Vil/Ville” was. The word refers to a small retail section of Wellesley adjacent to the college. The Vil/Ville nickname is a fond term students use for the village where they often travel in packs to sniff out a bargain at the Gap or to visit the local watering hole, Starbucks.  

Somewhere in the decade of wild hair, tight colorful spandex, and getting physical with Olivia Newton John, the Vil added an "le" to its spelling. Perhaps too many Wellesley students were involved in the current debates of the time to bother with spelling.  Most outsiders are unaware there’s ever been a debate: When I asked residents and shopkeepers about the spelling conundrum, they had no idea what I was talking about. 

The Associate Editor of Wellesley Magazine, Lisa Scanlon ‘99, was the most helpful in explaining why the correct spelling is “Vil.” In the 1930s, first year students were housed in the Vil. These residence halls were located where the retail section of Wellesley is today. The upperclassmen resident assistants who lived in the Vil were known as Vil juniors. Wellesley College has thorough documentation of all of this. The residence is spelled “Vil” in Wellesley Magazine’s Official Handbook. 

I was able to interview an alumna from the class of 1984. For security reasons, she did not wish to disclose her name or any information, but she did say that she wouldn’t think to spell Ville any other way.  This information left me at a standstill. Alumnae from the class of 1940 to the class of 1970 and some in the 80s used Vil. Sometime Alumnae from the mid 80s on, spelled it Ville. 

Fast forward a year and a half, I am still unable to define exactly when or why the change occurred. A very important person whose name I will not mention for my own protection, (she may or may not be a Trustee of Wellesley College) let’s call her Mrs. V-I-L, demands that my job is not to pin point the historical date of the spelling change but to educate the ignorant. To avoid any fights breaking out, the Wellesley College Communications and Public Affairs team avoids the word all together. Any sort of social media posting of the word can lead to seriously snarky comments (see picture above.) Interestingly enough, a recent post in my residence hall’s Google group requested a ride for a quick trip to the “V-I-L,” so she would not have to carry her heavy groceries back. I followed up with the email and did not see any foul play. Times they are a changing and it looks like current students are keeping to the 1938 traditions. Enraged alumnae from the 1980s who defend the added ‘L’ and ‘E’ might soon become a minority.
