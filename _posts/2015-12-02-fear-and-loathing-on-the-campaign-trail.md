In November 1972, President Richard Nixon was re-elected for a second term in office. Despite the hostile political climate Nixon faced in early 1972 as a result of the Vietnam War and a stagnant economy, he was granted a huge electoral mandate in the fall, winning [520 out of 538 electoral delegates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1972), and just over 60% of the popular vote. Many were left wondering how the Democrats could have possibly lost the election, especially by such a large margin. 

[Hunter S. Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson), National Correspondent for _Rolling Stone_, grapples with this question at the end of [_Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail_](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/timewarp-campaign-72-19730705). He spent a full year covering the campaign, following multiple candidates through the Democratic primaries and convention and eventually following the McGovern campaign until its defeat. 

Thompson begins following the candidates in December 1971. The book starts with coverage of the primaries, with Thompson travelling between the campaigns of the four major candidates for the Democratic nomination. Thompson covers both Democratic and Republican National Conventions, and, after the conventions, spends time following both the Nixon and McGovern campaigns. 

Although this book could have ended up as a very dry, politically correct summary of the facts of the campaign, Thompson’s personality and authenticity make this a captivating read. Thompson freely expresses his own opinions about the candidates, the campaign issues, and the events unfolding around him. He refers to his own unsuccessful run for public office (when he ran for Sheriff of Aspen, Colorado, as a candidate for the Freak Power Movement) and calls himself a “Three A’s Candidate”, meaning he is “Pro-Amnesty, Abortion, and Acid.” Throughout the book, the reader can get an idea of Thompson’s attitude towards the different candidates and key characters. This approach was [refreshing](http://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/15/books/thompson-1973-trail.html) compared to some styles of political journalism, where the writer carefully presents all viewpoints equally, without additional comment. Thompson’s responses are thought provoking, candid, and delivered with humor and an impeccably figurative writing style. Anyone who enjoys biting commentary and caricatures peppered with pop-culture and historical references will enjoy reading Thompson’s work. 

Thompson’s candidness in storytelling sometimes pushes the edges of professional journalism and literary practices. The entire book, except the last few chapters, was written in monthly installments for [_Rolling Stone_](http://www.rollingstone.com/). Thompson’s writing frequently rambles, goes off on tangents, and makes its point through several indirect stories, rather than a cohesive narrative running throughout each chapter. Thompson uses first person liberally and spends a not-insignificant portion of his writing talking about his own substance abuse, writer’s block, and inability to craft a nice article. It was surprising to hear about the drug and alcohol use that permeated the campaign trail throughout the book, from candidates showing signs of using illegal drugs, to press overtaking one of the chartered McGovern campaign planes and smoking, drinking, and harassing the crew during flights. 

Thompson makes no attempts to cover up his struggles as a writer. In fact, two of the later chapters in the book are not actually written by Thompson—they are transcripts of interviews between Thompson and his editor. Thompson suffered a nervous breakdown shortly after election night and was unable to write or type those chapters, and talking was the only way he was able to get the information down. He later recovered and wrote the final chapter, which analyzes what went wrong with McGovern campaign. 

Thompson’s internal struggle with the campaign is what makes the book so compelling. He begins the book as a disillusioned Democrat, who is unhappy with the “Party Machinery” (local and state level party bosses with a large level of political influence) and what he feels is a compromising, centrist position that the party has recently taken. His regard for McGovern rises during the primaries, as he begins to see McGovern as “not just another politician.” Then, a series of events that happened after the nomination cause him—and most of America, apparently—to lose faith in McGovern again. 

At the end of the book, Thompson is left more discouraged than ever before. He wonders if a candidate of integrity who promises real change—the kind of candidate McGovern appeared to be—could be successful in American politics. Would Americans elect someone like this? Thompson does not find a satisfactory answer to this question, but his search leaves readers with much to think about.
