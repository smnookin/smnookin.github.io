## What the Japanese Can Actually Learn from the Algeria Hostage Crisis

	A terrorism at a gas plant in Algeria, which happened right after the year 2013 began, hit many Japanese people as an unexpectedly shocking event—up to 10 Japanese workers were killed. Although it was widely discussed how the Japanese government should respond to such an event as terrorism, the heat of the issue seems to have cooled down. What has been and will be actually done? However, at the same time, another perspective can be cast onto this issue: a generation gap concerning terrorism.

	On January 16th, 2013, an al-Qaeda linked terrorist group attacked the multinationally-managed gas plant in In Amenas, Algeria. The Algerian government did not accept any negotiation with the terrorist group, and decided to carry out an assault on the very next day. About 40 hostages were killed through this event, includes10 Japanese people, all of whom were the workers at Japan Gasoline Company, which had been engaged in the construction of the plant since 1969.

	The Japanese government had been stating that saving human life was priority and that they would do their best to rescue all the Japanese workers there. Although 7 workers were rescued, 10 were eventually killed and 4 foreign workers were still missing. During and after this event, it was pointed out that the Japanese government had not made enough communication with the Algerian counterpart about the strategy and that they had been slow at confirming the safety of the people there. Overall, it was revealed that the government was lacking in the capacity to gather the sufficient information especially in an international emergency.

	Since it was right after the change of the administration, this was a crucial momentum for the new government to take a dynamic initiative. Trying to draw a lesson from this experience, they proposed that setting up “the Japanese version of National Security Council (NSC)” would be essential, which had been actually suggested for several years.

	In June, the related bill to set up the NSC was approved by the Cabinet, and this news was largely picked up by the newspapers. Its primary theme is enabling a speedy decision making and strengthening the system to gather and to analyze the information about diplomacy and security. In order to realize the first theme, the prime minister, the chief cabinet secretary, the foreign minister, and the defense minister would hold a meeting regularly.

	The second point is controversial. Foreign Ministry and National Police Agency are struggling for the initiative of information-gathering. The former insisted that it should belong to the secretariat of NSC, which they would have a major control. On the other hand, the latter claimed that they should remain in charge of information-gathering and the secretariat of NSC should stick to policy-making. The government intends to get through the bill this fall, but its attractiveness has gradually faded while the internal power game is going on.

	However, why in the first place did the In Amenas Hostage Crisis attract the Japanese attention? Or, did it really attract their attention so much?

	There seems to be a difference in the degree of the impact which this event gave—as an international terrorism in which Japanese people were involved--and the border is perhaps lined between those who have seen the news about the terrorism before 9.11 on a real-time basis and those who have not.

	9.11 certainly left a significantly strong impression of terrorism in the heart of the people all over the world. The term “terrorism” came to be used and seen much more frequently, and the particular name “al-Qaeda” became exponentially famous after this. Thus especially for the younger generation, this In Amenas Hostage Crisis can be said to be the first “terrorism” after 9.11, that is international and in which many Japanese were involved.

	However, for the older generation, they know many events related to terrorism before 9.11, such as the one at Tel-Aviv Airport in 1975 and the one in Luxor Palace in 1997, both of which Japanese people were deeply involved in. In fact, the former was done by some radical Japanese communists. For them, it could not have seemed so rare that Japanese people were involved in “terrorism”.

	As one of the influences which this event had, it unexpectedly showed the generation gap among the Japanese people about the perspective toward “terrorism”.
