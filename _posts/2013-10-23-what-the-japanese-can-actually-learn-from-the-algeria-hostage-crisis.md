## Two Features of the Algeria Hostage Crisis



	On January 16th, 2013, an al-Qaeda linked terrorist group attacked a multinationally-managed gas plant in In Amenas , Although the exact number of the casualties is yet to be known, at least 39 foreigners were said to be killed in the event, including 10 Japanese people, who worked for the Japan Gasoline Company. The incident shocked many in Japan, and the depth of the Japanese reaction can be seen in the reforms put in place by the government thereafter.

	At the time, the Japanese government said that saving human life was a priority and that it would do its best to rescue all the Japanese hostages. Some  were rescued, but 10 were eventually killed and 4 foreign employees were still missing. Since the 16th, the Japanese government had frequently contacted the counterparts of other involved countries, such as Britain, France, Norway, and Algeria, and agreed to cooperate in exchanging the latest information. It emphatically asked the Algerian government to make sure about the safety of human life. However, at dawn of the 20th, it was reported to the Japanese government that the Algerian government had completed the responsive assault to the terrorists, and it was obvious that it had prioritized the oppression of the terrorists over the rescue of the hostages. Despite the reasonable efforts by the Japanese government, it ended up in the loss of its 10 civilians. In this context, it was pointed out by various media that the current system of the Japanese government to deal with the international security emergency should be fundamentally reviewed.

	One important factor should be noted here; this incident happened only 20 days after Liberal Democratic Party of Japan had regained the position as the major party. Thus this was a crucial momentum for the new government to take a dynamic political initiative. Having learned from this experience, they proposed setting up “the Japanese version of National Security Council (NSC),” a move that had been discussed for several years.

	In June, the cabinet approved a related bill to set up the NSC. Its primary goals were to enable a speedy decision making process and to improve the government’s ability to gather and analyze security information. In order to realize the first theme, for instance, the prime minister, the chief cabinet secretary, the foreign minister, and the defense minister would hold a regular meeting and decide the basic policy concerning diplomacy and national defense.

	The second point is controversial. Over the initiative of information gathering, a large debate was sparked between Foreign Ministry and National Police Agency. The former insisted that the function should belong to the bureau of the NSC, which they would have a major control, whereas the latter claimed that the bureau of the NSC should stick to policy-making and the NPA should remain in charge of information-gathering. The government intends to pass the bill this fall, but while this internal power struggle raged on, the public interest in this reform has gradually faded.

	Thinking about the political situation at that time—right after the regime change—it’s reasonable that the Algeria Hostage Crisis attracted a lot of attention in the government, but did it generate the same interest among the Japanese society at that time?

	Let me briefly introduce my curious personal experience. After this incidence, I talked with my professor, who was around 40, about how shocking the news had been to me. 10 Japanese people were killed in the terrorist attack in Africa! I thought she would agree with me. However, her response made me surprised: “Why? It’s not rare that the Japanese people are involved in terrorism.”

	Of course, my personal surprise cannot be generalized, but where does this difference of reaction come from? Through analyzing this question, I came to think that how the Japanese people react to terrorist attacks might depend on whether or not they lived through similar incidents before the 9/11 attack.

	9/11 made “terrorism” regarded as an absolute international matter. The term “terrorism” came to be used and seen much more frequently, and the name “al-Qaeda” became exponentially more famous after this. As the first international terrorist attack after 9/11 that involved many Japanese people, the Algeria Hostage Crisis must have had a strong impression on younger Japanese people.

	The older generation, however, lived through multiple terrorist attacks before 9/11, such as Lod Airport massacre in 1975, Subway Sarin Incident in 1995 and Luxor massacre in 1997, all of which Japanese people were deeply involved in. In fact, the first and the second were carried out by Japanese people themselves. Although terrorism has also attracted their attention far more after 9/11, for them, it’s just that the notion of “terrorism” came to be recognized more worldwide but the involvement of Japanese people in terrorism isn’t such a new thing. It would be understandable if the Algeria Hostage Crisis didn’t attract so much attention from them as an international terrorist attack which involved many Japanese people.

	The Algeria Hostage Crisis is worth paying attention from political viewpoint. However, as one of the features this incident has, it unexpectedly revealed the generation gap among the Japanese people about the perspective toward "terrorism."
