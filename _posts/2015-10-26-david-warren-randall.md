[LEDE] Doctor David Warren Randall was born on [date] in [place], unaware that there was huge city full of new ideas just outside his front door. When he was [age] years old, he knew that he wanted to study psychology, and eventually studied at three different prestigious schools that ended with him receiving a doctorate in Clinical Psychology.  

Today, Randall enjoys running around with his three boys and dog, as well as running an entire office at one of the most competitive and stressful colleges in the world. 

MIT’s Student Support Services, an office that specializes in ensuring student health and success at MIT. The office sees about 5000 visits a year, and about 46% of a given class year before graduation. “What we have here is really unique,” Randall said.  It is difficult to find a similar support structure laid out so intricately yet clearly in other top-tier colleges.

In an interview with MIT’s newspaper, The Tech, Randall said, “We call ourselves deans, or administrators, who have a lot of experience working with students who have difficulties in their life.”
