title: MIT Administrators Struggle In Times of Campus Tradgedy

Last year saw [four confirmed MIT student suicides](http://www.boston.com/news/education/2015/09/01/after-tough-year-suicides-campus-mit-aims-improve-mental-health-culture/Gv6q0XaqjxpjTmkm2XxapO/story.html) and [a lot of press](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/16/mit-students-open-about-stress/dS61oA5tiKqjvVsJ5VZRAL/story.html?p1=Article_Related_Box_Article) about MIT's intense student stress levels.

Today, MIT is more than halfway through a fresh semester and a [new plan](http://cms350.com/mit/how-helpful-will-changes-to-mit-student-health-services-be-in-wake-of-recent-graduate-student-suicide.html) intended to decrease student stress levels and increase student resources on campus. Yet, even with a new plan in place, the administration is still thinking of ways that it can lower the stress and anxiety that it excalated across campus. Dr. David Warren Randall, the Director of MIT's Student Support Services (S3) on campus, was among the administrators deeply affected by the tradgedies of the past year.

"It obviously takes a toll on the students but from a practical perspective, it takes a toll on a lot of us." Randall said.

MIT’s [Student Support Services](http://mit.edu/uaap/s3/), or S3, entails an office that specializes in ensuring student health and success at MIT. The office sees about 5,000 visits a year, and about 50% of a given class year before graduation.  It is not always the case to find a similar support structure in other top-tier colleges that is not directly intertwined with mental health clinical services, or that is so resource-heavy for students.  "Many mental health and counseling centers are tiny;" Randall said, "we happen to have a huge service."

Randall oversees the entire service and manages day-to-day operations of the services. 

Randall has experienced his own fair of struggles, allowing him to empathize with students as they take a very short break from their hectic schedules to sit down and chat with him about their crazy lives. He obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Economics in 1996 from a private liberal arts college in upstate New York, followed with a two-year pre-doctoral internship at Brown University and a six-year course of study to finally receive his Ph. D. in Clinical Psychology.

"I always was the sort of person people came to when they wanted help." Randall said on why he studied clinical psychology. "When I went to school I just thought that I was going to major in psychology." Randall also said that his professors made the field seem extremely exciting.

Randall’s life quickly escalated as he and his wife got married and had three boys, all while moving around and eventually ending up at MIT’s S3. Randall and his wife, Beth, had three boys throughout the moves, Nathan, 11, Benji, 9, and Maxwell, 6. Randall started out as an Assistant Dean at S3 in 2005 and ended up as today’s Associate Dean and Director of the services.

And being a Dean and Director of S3 is difficult, especially when it comes to being a full-time director and a full-time parent. Randall says that his family is always the priority, but at times work seems to take over his life. 

"Its challenging. I try to be very efficient at work. I try to get all my work done during the day, but MIT makes it hard. I sometimes work later on when the kids are asleep. It takes really prioritizing." 

Randall says that when times are tough on campus, his life is very difficult and it becomes nearly impossible to keep work completely at work and not bring it home. "I think that the times that are the hardest are years like we had last year where it takes a toll on all of us," referring to the tragic suicides and other deaths that took place during the last two MIT semesters.

Randall told MIT's _The Tech_, “[MIT students] feel that they’re struggling but don’t want to get help because they think their peers are doing fine. This isn’t the case at all though." He continues, "I think people need to know that they’re not alone. Above all, every MIT student should know that even at their worst weeks, they are all extraordinary.”

There is no doubt that Randall does genuinely care about the happiness and success of the undergraduate student population. Not only does he stand as a member of many health and wellness boards on campus, but also he has a clear understanding of how students feel alone and are afraid of getting help. However, many students meet with Randall during the worst times of their lives, leading them to grow or feel hostile or aggressive towards him. For the most part, though, students look positively upon Randall and the other S3 deans.

"My impression is that [the S3 deans] are generally fairly useful and willing to work with students who are having problems," said Sarah Warkander, a senior at MIT.

Kayla Esquivel, a recent graduate of MIT pursuing her masters in engineering at MIT, said, "[Randall] was perfectly amiable when dealing with me, and I never had any serious problems with him, but I definitely heard horror stories form other people. Apparently he wasn't terribly good at being consistent with the things he claimed, and with the promises he would make."

And many students do agree that he means well. Barbara Duckworth, a junior at MIT, said "Overall, Dean Randall was really helpful. He responded to my calls when I was freaking out about getting back into MIT, and basically handled everything regarding teachers for the duration of my absence." 

After one of the deaths last year, Randall said "I went out to dinner with the family and the kids wanted to talk, so we went out to this dinner and they sitting there with a pile of nachos and they're talking to me and they were saying that they missed me and haven't seen me. And in the middle fo the dinner I got an important phone call and had to leave the table. I could not prioritize them when the campus was struggling."

And the [tough tradgedies](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/09/03/mit-bolsters-mental-health-services/26MMF8n9EbcxjZI3xVUxzI/story.html) of the past year did not just invade Randall's home life. It impacted his psyche.  "It was awful. I didn't get this job because I like tradgedy and want tradgedy to happen. I want to help people."

"Although none of these are one person's fault, I want to do whatever I can to make MIT as caring a community as possible. In the end, doing that is not enough. It makes you question the job and is what you are doing is a good enough job. It also creates some anxiety, everytime my phone rings now I worry, and that's not such a good feeling to have."
