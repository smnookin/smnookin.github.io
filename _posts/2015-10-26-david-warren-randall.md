[LEDE - Introduction Story about Randall:]

Doctor David Warren Randall was born on [date] in [place], unaware that there was huge city full of new ideas just outside his front door. When he was [age] years old, he knew that he wanted to study psychology, and eventually studied at three different prestigious schools that ended with him receiving a doctorate in Clinical Psychology.  

[Current Life of Dean Randall:]

Today, Randall enjoys running around with his three boys and dog, as well as running an entire office at one of the most competitive and stressful colleges in the world. 

MIT’s Student Support Services, or S3, entails an office that specializes in ensuring student health and success at MIT. The office sees about 5,000 visits a year, and about 50% of a given class year before graduation. “What we have here is really unique,” Randall said.  It is difficult to find a similar support structure in other top-tier colleges that is not directly intertwined with mental health clinical services.

In an interview with MIT’s newspaper, The Tech, Randall said, “We call ourselves deans, or administrators, who have a lot of experience working with students who have difficulties in their life.” The deans at S3 are known for being “lifesavers” for students in crisis, especially when it feels like they have no other outlets.

"My impression is that [the S3 Deans] are generally fairly useful and willing to work with students who are having problems," said Sarah Warkander, a senior at MIT.

However, many students have mixed feelings about individual deans, Randall included. Valentina Chamorro, a senior at MIT, stated that she has heard that Randall is “not a great dean in that he thinks people ask for too many extensions.”

Warkander continued her thoughts and said "there's an unfortunate level of variation dean-to-dean. Some of the deans are much more understanding than others, and there is really nowhere to go if they are unreasonable to you." She continues that sometimes deans will not follow up with things that they have promised to do, since the office is usually fairly busy. "In general I think [S3 is] a very good resource, but it would be good if there were more mechanisms to effectively appeal their decisions and get a second opinion from a different dean."

There is no doubt, however, that Randall does genuinely care about the happiness and success of the undergraduate student population. Not only does he stand as a member of many health and wellness boards on campus, but also he has a clear understanding of how students feel alone and are afraid of getting help. 

Randall told The Tech, “[MIT students] feel that they’re struggling but don’t want to get help because they think their peers are doing fine. This isn’t the case at all though." He continues, "I think people need to know that they’re not alone. Above all, every MIT student should know that even at their worst weeks, they are all extraordinary.” 

[Past Life (and struggles) of Dean Randall:]

Randall has experienced his own fair of struggles, allowing him to empathize with students as they take a very short break from their hectic schedules to sit down and chat with him about their crazy lives. He obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Economics in 1996 from a private liberal arts college in upstate New York, followed with a two-year pre-doctoral internship at Brown University and a six-year course of study to finally receive his Ph. D. in Clinical Psychology.

[Insert quote from Randall about his pursuing of his Ph. D. Why did he choose clinical psychology? Did he know he wanted to work at a place like S3? What was it like moving around all the time? Major challenges in his work?]

Randall’s life quickly escalated as he and his wife and three boys moved around and eventually ended up at MIT’s S3, starting out as an Assistant Dean in 2005 and ending up as today’s Associate Dean and Director of the services.
