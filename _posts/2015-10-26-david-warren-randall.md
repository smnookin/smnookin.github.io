From A Tech Article about S3: [http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N59/s3.html]
“We call ourselves deans, or administrators, who have a lot of experience working with students who have difficulties in their life,” said Dr. David Randall, an Associate Dean and Director of S3. Under his leadership, the organization sees about 5000 visits a year. 

One of the issues Randall tackles on a day-to -day basis is the “one-upmanship” culture of MIT. “We see it all the time. And, frankly, I don’t think it works for students,” said Randall. “But when students come into my office, they don’t have to play that ‘I’m more hosed’ game. They don’t have to prove anything to me.” 

Once this pressure is taken off, Randall says it becomes easier for students to evaluate their own happiness and understand they are not alone in their plight. “They feel that they’re struggling but don’t want to get help because they think their peers are doing fine. This isn’t the case at all though. 56 percent of last year’s graduating class sat right there in that chair at least one time last year.” 

Randall calls being hosed the “big elephant” in the room; he believes that MIT students are all dealing with high levels of stress, though not many want to admit it. “I think people need to know that they’re not alone. That was the power of Lydia’s blog post” — referring to a recent MIT admissions blog post by Lydia K. ’14 titled “Meltdown” (see page 14 for the full text) — “because it showed people that others are in the same boat. Many of these highly driven, high school valedictorian types don’t realize that there are other freshmen and upperclassmen out there with the same problems as them. Above all, every MIT student should know that even at their worst weeks, they are all extraordinary.” 

Randall completed a PhD in psychology from Penn State University.
